The first step in quantifying our lack of knowledge involves the precise identification of the research entities of interest. The elements of this collection depend largely on the specific application of the theory of nescience. Each application requires a distinct set of entities, whether mathematical objects, living organisms, human needs, or otherwise. Fortunately, the process of quantifying what we do not know remains consistent across all such domains.

The next step is to devise a procedure for representing the identified entities as strings of symbols. Accurately encoding a research entity is a complex and unresolved epistemological challenge. The solution proposed within the theory of nescience is based on the concept of oracle Turing machine. The practical feasibility of this solution depends largely on the abstractness of the entities being studied. For example, encoding abstract mathematical objects poses significant difficulties and often requires an approximation. In contrast, encoding computer programs is relatively straightforward, as they are already expressed as strings.

Once a suitable method for encoding the original entities into string-based representations has been established, the final step is to produce a description. This description should be both accurate and concise, reflecting our current understanding of the representation. In the theory of nescience, descriptions are required to be computable, meaning that a computer must be able to fully reconstruct the original representation from its description. However, descriptions refer to representations, that is, the way entities are encoded, not to the entities themselves. As a result, how well a description captures knowledge about an entity depends largely on the quality of the representation used.

In this chapter, we will formalize these core concepts: entities, representations, and descriptions, among others. We will also explore what constitutes a perfect description, how to compute the combined representation of multiple entities, and how to describe a representation assuming some prior background knowledge. Additionally, we will examine the concept of a research area and its associated properties.

\section{Entities}
\label{sec:descriptions_entities}

Defining the nature of a research entity is a complex and unresolved philosophical problem. We approach this complexity from a fundamentally pragmatic perspective, rather than a philosophical-otological one. Our theory starts from the premise that there exists a non-empty set of \emph{entities}\index{Entities} that we seek to understand.

\begin{notation}
We represent the set of research entities of interest as $\mathcal{E}$.
\end{notation}

The contents of $\mathcal{E}$ depend on the specific domain in which theory of nescience is employed, and are usually aligned with a specific area of knowledge. Examples of entity sets could include: research components in mathematics (abstract); the kingdom Animalia (living entities); known and unknown human needs (abstract); all potential computer programs (strings), etc. From a formal point of view, $\mathcal{E}$ is not a well-defined set, since there is usually no rule or procedure for deciding which elements comprise this set.

The abstract nature of $\mathcal{E}$ offers certain advantages, but also imposes significant restrictions. The main restriction is that our definition of nescience is, in most cases, a non-computable quantity, which requires the use of approximations in practice. The main advantage is that the new concepts and methods presented in this book can be applied to a wide range of problems, not limited only to the search for new scientific knowledge.

In the theory of nescience, the possibility of using universal sets is excluded; that is, the existence of a set $\xi$ containing everything cannot be assumed. The problem with universal sets is that they contravene Cantor's theorem (see the example \ref{cantor_theorem}). Cantor's theorem proves that the power set $\mathcal{P}(\xi)$, consisting of all possible subsets of $\xi$, has more elements than the original set $\xi$. This contradicts the assumption that $\xi$ includes everything. In the theory of nescience, the set $\mathcal{E}$ must be a specific set.

\begin{example}[Cantor's theorem]\index{Cantor's theorem}
\label{cantor_theorem}
Cantor's theorem proves that for any set $A$, $d(A) < d\left(\mathcal{P}(A)\right)$. Consider $f: A \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(A)$, a function that maps each element $x \in A$ to the set $\{x\} \in \mathcal{P}(A)$; evidently, $f$ is injective, implying $d(A) \leq d\left(\mathcal{P}(A)\right)$. To substantiate that the inequality is strict, let's assume there exists a surjective function $g: A \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(A)$ and consider the set $B = \{ x \in A : x \notin g(x) \}$. As $g$ is surjective, there must exist a $y \in A$ such that $g(y) = B$. This, however, raises a contradiction, $y \in B \Leftrightarrow y \notin g(y) = B$. Consequently, the function $g$ cannot exist, therefore $d(A) < d\left(\mathcal{P}(A)\right)$.
\end{example}

In the theory of nescience, not all conceivable sets are acceptable, as some may give rise to paradoxes. Take, for example, Russell's paradox, which proposes a set $R$ consisting of all sets that are not members of themselves. The paradox arises when we try to discern whether $R$ is a member of itself (see the example \ref{ex:russell_paradox}). To avoid such problems, the theory of nescience is based on the Zermelo-Fraenkel axiom set, along with the Axiom of Choice. The \emph{axiom of separation}\index{Axiom of Separation} (if $P$ is a property with parameter $p$, then for any set $x$ and parameter $p$ there exists a set $y=\{u \in x : P(u) \}$ that includes all those sets $u \in x$ that have property $P$) allows the use of this notation only to construct sets that are subsets of already existing sets. A more extensive \emph{axiom of comprehension}\index{Axiom of comprehension} (if $P$ is a property, then there exists a set $y=\{u : P(u) \}$) would be required to allow sets like the one proposed by Russell's paradox. Russell's paradox arises from the use of an unrestricted comprehension principle. In the axioms of ZFC, and in the theory of nescience, the axiom of comprehension is considered false.

\begin{example}[Russell's Paradox]\index{Russell's Paradox}
\label{ex:russell_paradox}
Suppose $R$ is the set of all sets not members of themselves, such that $R = \{ x : x \notin x \}$. The contradiction arises when querying if $R$ is a member of itself. If $R$ is not a member of itself, by its own definition, it should be; conversely, if $R$ is declared to be a member of itself, its definition dictates it should not be. Symbolically, this can be written as $R \in R \Leftrightarrow R \notin R$.
\end{example}

In the theory of nescience, we do not address the classic problems of ontology, that is, the classification of entities that exist in the world and can be known. Furthermore, we do not attempt to resolve epistemological questions, such as how scientific knowledge is validated by evidence, or what the nature of that evidence is.

Once a set $\mathcal{E}$ of entities has been selected, the next step is to uniquely encode them as strings of symbols, which will make them easier to describe. A method for doing this encoding efficiently is described in the following section.

\section{Representations}
\label{sec:representations}

The representation of the entities that compose the set $\mathcal{E}$, which can be abstract in nature, poses important epistemological challenges that have been the subject of research for more than two millennia (see Section \ref{sec:scientific_representation} for a brief overview of the solutions proposed by the scientific community and their limitations). This book describes a possible solution to this complex problem, which has certain advantages, but also disadvantages. Our approach proposes dividing the problem of scientific representation into two interconnected subproblems: the encoding of entities by means of representations, and the modeling of these representations by means of descriptions. Thus, scientific models would explain the entities indirectly through their representations (see Figure \ref{fig:representationProblem} in the Introduction of the book, reproduced in this section for ease of reference). In this section we will focus on the aspects related to encoding, and in Section \ref{sec:descriptions_models} on the descriptions.

Within the field of Kolmogorov complexity\index{Kolmogorov complexity}, the representation issue is tackled by presupposing that the set $\mathcal{E}$ is well-defined, countable, and that a total encoding function $f:\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ exists, mapping the set of entities to the set of natural numbers (akin to Gödel numbering\index{Gödel numbering}). The nescience theory similarly embraces this concept of encoding entities via numbers, or, in other words, strings of symbols. However, our approach to the problem of encoding an arbitrary set $\mathcal{E}$ involves an inversion of the problem. This involves defining a partial function $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}:\mathcal{S}^\ast \rightarrow \mathcal{E}$ that maps the well-defined set $\mathcal{S}^\ast$ (comprising all possible finite strings from an alphabet $\mathcal{S}$) to the potentially non-countable and non-well defined set $\mathcal{E}$ containing the entities of interest.

Our function $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}$, which depends on the set $\mathcal{E}$, operates much like an oracle (taking inspiration from the concept of an oracle Turing machine\index{Oracle Turing machine} as per Definition \ref{def:Oracle-Turing-Machine}). This function has the capacity to entirely reconstruct an entity $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E} (x) \in \mathcal{E}$ using its encoding string $x \in \mathcal{S}^\ast$, without the need for additional information. Evidently, this oracle is an abstract concept, and its construction in the real world would be impossible for most sets $\mathcal{E}$. However, the theoretical existence of this oracle assists in the elucidation and verification of key attributes of the scientific discovery process. Due to its oracle nature, $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}$ has limitations with respect to the mathematical operations in which it can be used, as will be explained in the subsequent paragraphs.

Our premise is based on the assumption that there exists a single, objective physical world that is independent of observers. In addition, we assume that, for certain collections of entities $\mathcal{E}$, it is logically coherent to postulate the existence of an oracle $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}$ (see the discussion of the scientific representation problem in Section~\ref{sec:scientific_representation}).

For the purposes of this book, without any loss of generality, we will exclusively regard binary strings as the means of encoding entities.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:descriptions_topic}
Given $\mathcal{E}$ as a set of entities, a \emph{representation function}\index{Representation function} is defined as an oracle partial function $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}:\mathcal{B}^\ast \rightarrow \mathcal{E}$ that maps elements of the set $\mathcal{B}^\ast$, which comprises all conceivable finite binary strings, to the elements of the set $\mathcal{E}$, corresponding to the entities under examination.
\end{definition}

Within this framework, only the elements of the set $\mathcal{B}^\ast$, that is, binary strings, are eligible to serve as representations of entities (see problem of ontology\index{Problem of ontology} in Section \ref{sec:scientific_representation}). We do not permit other forms of physical models, including drawings, unless they can be transcribed into binary strings. We do not distinguish between scientific representations and other forms of representations (see representational demarcation\index{Representational demarcation} in Section \ref{sec:scientific_representation}). The oracle assumes the responsibility of determining which entity is encoded by each representation. It is also pivotal to note that the oracle $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}$ is a partial function, meaning not all potential strings represent entities (targetless models\index{Targetless models} are allowed in the theory of nescience, see Section \ref{sec:targetless_representations} and Section \ref{sec:scientific_representation}).

\begin{example}
\label{ex:not_unique_oracle}
For a given set of entities $\mathcal{E}$, the existence of a representation oracle $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}$ does not imply its uniqueness. For instance, a binary negation oracle (which transforms the zeros of a binary string into ones, and the ones into zeros), assigning to each string $x \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ the entity $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E} \left( \neg x \right)$, would also qualify as a representation function.
\end{example}

Rather than deploying individual oracles, we could have employed a universal oracle machine. This is a machine $\mathcal{U}_\mathcal{O}$ which, given the encoding of an oracle $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}$ and a string $s$ as input, computes $\mathcal{U}_\mathcal{O} \left( \langle \mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}, s \rangle \right) = \mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E} \left( s \right)$. Universal machines are particularly applicable to the universal set $\xi$, encompassing all entities. However, such an approach would complicate the process of scientific discovery in practical terms. Instead, we choose to work with entity sets $\mathcal{E}$ corresponding to different areas of knowledge, choosing a single oracle $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}$ for each set $\mathcal{E}$ (the most suitable one according to our current knowledge and our practical needs).

\begin{example}
\label{ex:description_dna}
Consider the case when the subjects of study are animals. Initially, one might use detailed physical descriptions of the animals as encodings. In this scenario, the oracle would be a hypothetical machine capable of reconstructing the original animal from its description. As our understanding of biology advances, we might instead adopt an alternative encoding based on the animals' DNA. Both of these encodings serve as valid representations of the entities.
\end{example}

As illustrated in Example \ref{ex:not_unique_oracle} and Example \ref{ex:description_dna}, the entities in $\mathcal{E}$ can be encoded in multiple ways (see the problem of style\index{Problem of style} in Section \ref{sec:scientific_representation}). Different oracles accommodate different encoding schemes. Some strings provide more accurate representations of an entity than others (see the standard of accuracy\index{Standard of Accuracy} in Section \ref{sec:scientific_representation}). The optimal representation depends on the type of questions we aim to answer. Using a particular encoding style with an oracle designed for a different style may lead to unexpected outcomes. Our objective should be to employ representations that minimize the size of the oracle—that is, the amount of prior knowledge presumed to be embedded within it.

\begin{example}
Consider $\mathbf{X}_t$ as a time series consisting of $m$ measurements $x_1, \ldots, x_m$ collected at fixed intervals from a physical phenomenon exhibiting sinusoidal behavior. Suppose we have trained a multi-layer perceptron\index{Multi-layer perceptron} neural network $nn$ that perfectly fits the data, meaning it returns $x_t$ when given a time $t$ as input. By analyzing the cycles in the time series, one would naturally identify a sine function as the most appropriate model for the underlying physical process. However, no existing machine learning methodology would arrive at this conclusion if provided solely with the neural network's architecture (i.e., the number of layers, their sizes, and the trained weights). Clearly, the oracle is sufficiently powerful to recognize this underlying structure.
\end{example}

Remember that the oracle operates as a partial function, meaning that not every string must represent an entity. The less information a representation contains, the more difficult it becomes to understand how the oracle works. It is essential to be cautious with representations that fail to capture the full structure of the original entities, as this can introduce bias into our analyses. Chapter \ref{chap:Miscoding} offers a detailed discussion of the types of errors arising from the miscoding of abstract entities, emphasizing that representations must not only correspond to entities, but also that entities must be relevant to their representations (see the requirement of directionality\index{Requirement of directionality} in Section \ref{sec:scientific_representation}).

We employ an oracle function rather than an oracle relation $\mathcal{R}_\mathcal{O} \subset \mathcal{B}^\ast \times \mathcal{E}$, not to merely associate strings with their corresponding entities, but to reconstruct an entity from its representation. The oracle's ability to recover original entities underpins our capacity to make hypotheses about entities based on their representations (see surrogative reasoning\index{Surrogative reasoning} in Section \ref{sec:scientific_representation}). According to the theory of nescience, scientific inquiry involves not only learning how to encode entities properly but also understanding the mechanisms by which oracles decode them. For scientific inquiry to be practically effective, these oracles should ideally be minimal in size.

The purpose of encoding entities in the theory of nescience differs fundamentally from that in Shannon's information theory (see Chapter \ref{chap:Coding}), as illustrated in Example \ref{ex:shannon_encoding}.

\begin{example}
\label{ex:shannon_encoding}
Take, for instance, a set $\mathcal{E}$ consisting of two books: "The Ingenious Nobleman Sir Quixote of La Mancha" and "The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet". We might encode the first book with the string "0" and the second with the string "1". While these strings allow us to uniquely identify each book within the set, they do not qualify as valid encodings within the framework of the theory of nescience. In information theory, the goal is to uniquely identify an object based on a reference, assuming mutual agreement between the sender and the receiver about the mapping from references to objects. In contrast, the theory of nescience seeks representations that preserve the richness and detail of the original entities. For example, it would be impossible to hypothesize about Cervantes' influence on Shakespeare using only the strings "0" and "1".
\end{example}

One possible response to the limitation discussed in Example \ref{ex:shannon_encoding}, where entities are encoded using overly simplistic strings that fail to capture their internal structure, would be to require the set $\mathcal{E}$ to be infinite, as is done in Kolmogorov complexity. This requirement avoids pathological cases in which too many entities are assigned trivial or arbitrary encodings. However, merely increasing the size of $\mathcal{E}$ does not solve the fundamental issue: even with an infinite set of entities, many encoding schemes still fall short of supporting surrogative reasoning. That is, they do not allow us to make meaningful inferences about the original entities based solely on their representations. To enable such reasoning, the encoding must preserve essential structural and semantic features of the entities, not just their identity.

We distinguish between \emph{knowable} and \emph{unknowable} entities. Knowable entities are those that can, in principle, be understood through scientific inquiry (see Section \ref{sec:what-is-an-entity}). Unknowable entities, on the other hand, lie beyond the reach of human comprehension—either because they are inherently inaccessible to observation and reasoning, or because they exceed the cognitive or methodological limits of science.

\begin{definition}
We say that an entity $e \in \mathcal{E}$ is \emph{knowable}\index{Knowable entity} if there exists at least one $r \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ such that $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}(r) = e$. An entity $e \in \mathcal{E}$ is \emph{unknowable}\index{Unknowable entity} if it is not knowable.
\end{definition}

A priori, it is not possible to determine whether an entity $e \in \mathcal{E}$ is knowable, unknowable, or only partially knowable. Identifying suitable knowable entities for study is a matter of trial and error. In this book, we say nothing further about unknowable entities, except to note that their unknowability can neither be proven nor discovered.

\begin{definition}
Let $e \in \mathcal{E}$ be a knowable entity. We define the \emph{set of representations}\index{Set of representations} for $e$, denoted by $\mathcal{R}_e$, as $\{ r \in \mathcal{B}^\ast : \mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E} (r) = e \}$.
\end{definition}

In Figure \ref{fig:entities_topics_1}, we present a depiction of a hypothetical oracle mapping from the set of finite binary strings $\mathcal{B}^\ast$ to the set of entities $\mathcal{E}$. The figure also highlights a particular entity $e_1$, the subset of strings $\mathcal{R}_{e_1}$ that represent this entity, and a specific representation $r_1$. Since the set $\mathcal{E}$ is, in general, not well defined, the inverse function $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}^{-1}(e_1)$ cannot be computed in practice.

A consequence of working with finite strings as representations is that some entities may not be encoded by any representation (see the gray areas in Figure \ref{fig:entities_topics_1}; in particular, the entity $e_2$ is not encoded by any string). Intuitively, this reflects the fact that, in certain domains of knowledge, the number of possible problems far exceeds the number of available solutions.

\begin{example}
If the collection of entities under study consists of real numbers, then there exist numbers that cannot be encoded using finite binary strings. This is because the set $\mathbb{R}$ has the cardinality of the continuum, whereas the set $\mathcal{B}^\ast$ is countable.
\end{example}

Since our knowledge of the entities and the internal workings of the oracle is incomplete, in practice we work with a different set of strings, denoted by $\hat{\mathcal{R}}_e$, which we believe are close approximations of the true representations $\mathcal{R}_e$ that encode the entity $e$. The elements of this set typically change over time, as our understanding of the entities in $\mathcal{E}$ and of how the oracle encodes them improves. The more abstract the set of entities is, the more difficult it becomes to approximate them as strings (see Chapter \ref{chap:Miscoding}).

\begin{example}
\label{ex:luminiferous_ether}
The entity "luminiferous ether"\index{Luminiferous ether} was a theoretical postulate describing a hypothetical medium through which light was believed to propagate. It was proposed to explain how wave-based light could travel through empty space. However, in 1887, the Michelson-Morley experiment\index{Michelson-Morley experiment} provided strong evidence against the existence of ether. Later, Einstein's special theory of relativity\index{Theory of relativity} offered a successful explanation for the propagation of light in a vacuum, leading to the complete abandonment of the ether concept.
\end{example}

If the chosen oracle is not minimal, determining whether a string is a valid representation of an entity requires understanding the internal workings of the oracle. A *non-minimal oracle* is one in which part of the information needed to reconstruct the original entity is embedded within the oracle itself, rather than being explicitly encoded in the representation string. Although using non-minimal oracles can simplify the research process by offloading complexity to the oracle, it obscures the boundary between what is encoded and what is assumed, making it harder to analyze or generalize the representation mechanism.

\begin{remark}
One of the fundamental challenges in science—and in human intellectual activity more broadly—is the tendency to confuse symbols with the things they represent. The theory of nescience has been carefully designed to avoid this issue by clearly distinguishing between research entities and their representations. However, making this distinction explicit at every step would render the book unnecessarily difficult to read. We have aimed to strike a balance between clarity of exposition and rigor of definition. Occasionally, especially when introducing new ideas, we use the term \emph{topic} to refer broadly to an entity, a representation, or both. Nevertheless, in all mathematical definitions and propositions, this distinction is made unambiguous. In case of any uncertainty, the formal definitions should be taken as the definitive reference.
\end{remark}

\section{Invalid Representations}
\label{sec:invalid_representations}

It might happen that the representation we are using for an entity $e \in \mathcal{E}$ is an incorrect one, that is, instead of working with a string $r \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ that perfectly encodes $e$, we are studying another string $r' \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ that it is, hopefully, close to $r$ but not necessarily equal. We are interested in to compute the distance between the string $r'$ and the perfect one $r$ as a quantitative measure of the error we are introducing due to the use of a wrong encoding. Unfortunately, we do not know $r$, since for the majority of the practical applications, it does not exists a computable function from $\mathcal{E}$ to $\mathcal{B}^\ast$. The only thing we have to our disposal is an abstract oracle machine $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}$ that knows which strings represents each entity. Recall from Section \ref{sec:representations} that we propose to address the scientific representation problem by introducing an abstract oracle $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}:\mathcal{B}^\ast \rightarrow \mathcal{E}$ from the set $\mathcal{B}^\ast$ of all possible finite binary strings to the set $\mathcal{E}$ of entities under study.

We start by distinguishing between valid representations, that is strings that contain all the relevant information required by the selected oracle to reconstruct an entity, and non-valid representations.

\begin{definition}
Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a collection of entities, and $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}$ an encoding function. We define the set of \emph{valid} representations for $\mathcal{E}$ given the encoding function $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}$, denoted by $\mathcal{R}^\star_{\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}}$, as the subset of representations that perfectly encode an entity of $\mathcal{E}$, according to $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}$.
\end{definition}

The set $\mathcal{R}^\star_{\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}}$ is, in general, unknown, since it is a subset of $\mathcal{B}^\ast$ whose definition depends on an abstract, not well defined, oracle. Intuitively, a representation is valid if it contains all the details required so that the oracle can reconstruct the original entity without requiring the use of external information. A valid representation cannot contain wrong symbols nor relevant information can be missing, since in that case the oracle would not be able to reconstruct the entity. Moreover, we require that the oracle is not only able to reconstruct an entity given a representation but it can also derive the set of valid representations given an entity. In this sense, an entity that contains non-relevant information cannot be valid, since that part of the string cannot be generated by the oracle given the entity.

\begin{example}
The data used in time of Ptolomeo about the position of celestial bodies along the year was a non-valid encoding of the entity "position of celestial bodies", since the data was inaccurate. A better encoding was the data collected by Tycho Brahe. Today, we have even better encodings. Adding to the dataset the name of the person who collected the data is an example of a representation that includes non-relevant information.
\end{example}

Recall that we do not allow other representations of entities except finite binary strings. Drawings, mathematical formulas, or datasets can be used as representations as long as they can be encoded as strings and are recognized as valid representations by the selected oracle. Each string represents one, and only one entity. Of course, different oracles will define different sets of valid representations. In general, we will assume that a particular representation oracle $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}$ has been selected to encode the set $\mathcal{E}$ of entities in which we are interested.

\begin{notation}
We will denote the set of valid representations of $\mathcal{E}$ by $\mathcal{R}^\star_\mathcal{E}$ if there is no ambiguity about which oracle $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}$ we are using.
\end{notation}

We can define the set of valid representations of a single entity $e$ in the same way.

\begin{definition}
We define the set of valid representations for an entity $e \in \mathcal{E}$, denoted by $\mathcal{R}^\star_e$, as the subset of representations that perfectly encode the entity $e$, that is, $\mathcal{R}^\star_e = \mathcal{R}^\star_\mathcal{E} \cap \mathcal{R}_e$.
\end{definition}

As we have seen in Example \ref{ex:description_dna} there could be more than one valid representation for some entities, even it the oracle is restricted to a particular style. It might also happen that the set of valid representations is empty, that is, there is no valid representation for that entity. In that case the entity will be unknowable.

\begin{notation}
We denoted by $r^\star_e \in \mathcal{R}^\star_\mathcal{E}$ the fact that $r$ is a valid representation of the entity $e$.
\end{notation}

All possible strings represent an entity, even the non-valid representations, like wrong or incomplete ones. A consequence of working with approximations instead of the true representations is that some of the candidate strings currently in use might encode a different entity from what we were expecting.

\begin{example}
\label{ex:polywater}
In 1961, the Soviet physicist Nikolai Fedyakin, performed a series of experiments resulting in what was seemingly a new form of water. The new water, called polywater, showed a higher boiling point, a lower freezing point, and much higher viscosity than ordinary water. Later experiment showed that polywater was nothing more than contaminated water with small amounts of impurities.
\end{example}

{\color{red}

We can safely assume (it is free from logical contradictions) that the oracle machine not only knows which representations encode which entities, but also how far is a string $r$ from being a valid representation $r^\star_e$, for all $r \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ and all $r^\star_e \in \mathcal{R}^\star_\mathcal{E}$. 

If a representaton $r$ is non-valid, the oracle will find the closest possible representation that it is valid, and assume that they represent the same entity.

The oracle defines an equivalence relation that splits the set $\mathcal{L}$ into equivalence classes. Each equivalence class corresponds to an entity of $\mathcal{E}$, and it might happens that not all entities of $\mathcal{E}$ have an associated class (what we have called the unknowable unknown). All the strings are related to some entity, and some of them would be better than others (i.e. lower nescience). No string can be part of two different entities. For each collection of $\mathcal{E}$ there could be more than one valid oracle.

\begin{proposition}
Axioms A1, A2 and A3 state that the oracle $\mathcal{O}$ is an equivalence relation
\begin{itemize}
\item[A1] $\forall t \in \mathcal{L} \; t \mathcal{O} t$.
\item[A2] $\forall s , t \in \mathcal{L}$ if $s \mathcal{O} t$ then $t \mathcal{O} s$.
\item[A3] $\forall r, s , t \in \mathcal{L}$ if $r \mathcal{O} s$ and $s \mathcal{O} t$ then $r \mathcal{O} t$.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}
Let $\mathcal{L} / \mathcal{O}$ be the quotation set defined by the oracle relation over the language set. We call \emph{entity}, denoted by $[e]$, to every class of this quotation set, that is, $[e] \in \mathcal{L} / \mathcal{O}$.
\end{definition}

\section{Joint Representations}
\label{sec:descriptions_joint_topic}

We have seen in the previous section that there exists more than one way to encode an entity $e \in \mathcal{E}$, what we have called the set $\mathcal{R}_e$ of representations of the entity. Some of these representations have a high quality, in the sense that they contain all the information required by the oracle to reconstruct (in whatever way the oracle manages to do that) the original entity. But also, in the set $\mathcal{R}_e$ there exists low quality representations, that is, representations that lack many of the details needed to fully reconstruct the entity. Furthermore, the set $\mathcal{R}_e$ can contain representations that include information that is wrong, symbols that the oracle will automatically ignore during the reconstruction, but that they will mislead us when understanding the entity. In Chapter \ref{chap:Miscoding} we will study how to measure the error due to incomplete and wrong representations, and in this section we will introduce a mechanism to improve our currently known representations.

If we want to increase our knowledge about an entity, we have to find the best possible representation for that entity, that is, a representation that is complete and correct. One way to do that is simply try different strings until we come up with a high quality representation. However, that method could require a lot of time and it is impractical. A more efficient approach would be to complement our current bad representation with more (potentially missing) symbols, or by combining those known representations that contain partial information. These two methods require the introduction of the concept of joint representation.

\begin{definition}
Let $s, t \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be two different representations. We call \emph{joint representation} of $s$ and $t$ to the concatenation string $st$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
\label{ex:lung_cancer}
{\color{red} TODO: use an example in which we talk about concatenating two representations, but do not mention the quality of the individual and joint representations (this is covered in the chapter of miscoding)}
Suppose that the research entity $e$ in which we are interested is the causes of lung cancer. In order to understand this entity, we have measured a collection of risk factors in a random sample of the population (smooking, exercise, diet, age, etc.). However, due to a problem with the sampling procedure, all the samples correspond to a subset of the population, for example, males. This dataset would be a representation $s$ for our entity $e$, but a very bad one, since it is strongly biased. If we have a second representation, corresponding the sample data of females $t$, the joint representation $st$ will be a better one that any of them, $s$ or $t$, isolated.
\end{example}

The concatenation of any two arbitrary representations is also a representation.

\begin{proposition}
Let $s, t \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be two different representations and $st$ its joint representation, then $st$ is also a representation.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
As we have seen in Section \ref{sec:strings} the set $\mathcal{B}^\ast$ is closed under the operation of concatenation of strings, and the representation function $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E}$ is total.
\end{proof}

We do not require the set of representations $\mathcal{R}_e$ for a given entity $e \in \mathcal{E}$ to be closed under the operation of concatenation. That is, it might happen that $st \notin \mathcal{R}_e$, even if it is the case that $s \in \mathcal{R}_e$ and $t \in \mathcal{R}_e$.

The concept of joint representation is defined for every pair of strings $s, t \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$, even if they do not belong to the same set of representations $\mathcal{R}_e$, in other words, when $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E} \left( s \right) \neq \mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E} \left( t \right)$. This process of joining representations from different entities will be very usefull for the discovery of new research entities hitherto unknown (see Section \ref{sec:New_Research_Topics} and recall that all possible strings in $\mathcal{B}^\ast$ represent an entity).

The operation of string concatenation is associative, that is, $(rs)t = r(st)$, for all $r, s, t \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$. This property defines the algebraic structure of the sets of representations.

\begin{proposition}
The set $\mathcal{B}^\ast$ of representations together with the operation of concatenation has the structure of free monoid.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
As we have seen in Section \ref{sec:strings} the operation of string concatenation in $\mathcal{B}^\ast$ is associative, and the empty string $\lambda$ plays the role of neutral element.
\end{proof}

We do no require the operation of joining representations to be conmutative with respect to the oracle function. Given the representations $s, t \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ it might happen that the concatenation strings $st$ and $ts$ represent different entities, that is, $\mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E} \left( st \right) \neq \mathcal{O}_\mathcal{E} \left( ts \right)$.

The concept of joint representation can be extended to any arbitrary, but finite, collection of representations. In this way, we could add multiple partial representations to our research, or use them in the process of discovering new entities.

\begin{definition}
Let $r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be a finite collection of representations. We call \emph{joint representation} of $r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n$ to the string $r_1 r_2 \ldots r_n$.
\end{definition}

It is easy to show that $r_1 r_2 \ldots r_n \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ for all $r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$, that is, $\mathcal{B}^\ast$ is closed under the operation of concatenation of multiple, finite, representations.

{\color{red}

We have seen that the contatenation of two or more representations of an entity can encode a different entity than the original one. This can even happen when the two representations to join encode the same entity.

multiple representations of the same entity can help us to find a better representation. We can take advantage of this property to discover new, previously unknown entities, by means of combining the representations of the already known entities. Intuitively, we are looking for new entities by creating new representations that are different from the representations we already know.

TODO: Formalize this idea with a proposition.

Provide an example of how it can be applied in practice.

\section{Descriptions}
\label{sec:descriptions_models}

So far, our aim with the strings of $\mathcal{B}^\ast$ has been to provide an enconding, or representation, as complete and detailed as possible of the entities of $\mathcal{E}$, no matter its length. However, as we have said in the preface of this book, human understanding requires the derivation of concise models for those entities, since human reasoning cannot be based on long representations.

\begin{example}
In Example \ref{ex:lung_cancer} we have shown that a good representation for the entity "lung cancer" could be a sample dataset in which we measure different risk factors. If smokers decide to quit smooking is not because they know and understand this large sample dataset, but because they know and understand the much simpler derived model "smooking increases the risk of lung cancer".
\end{example}

A description or model\footnote{In the theory of nescience use the words "description" and "model" interchangeably.} is a finite binary string mapped to a representation of an entity (recall Figure \ref{fig:entities_topics_models} from Chapter \ref{chap:Introduction}). Descriptions do not model entities (target systems) directly, they do so through string based representations. In the theory of nescience we require that descriptions must be computable, so we can fully and effectively reconstruct the original representations given their descriptions. The requirement of computability allows us to clearly state the limits of the concept of "description". For example, the problem of self-referential descriptions, like the Berry paradox\index{Berry paradox}, can be addressed in the scope of the limits of computation.

\begin{definition} [Model]
\label{def:descriptions_model}
Let $d \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be a binary string in the form $d = \langle TM,a \rangle$, where $TM$ is the encoding of a prefix free Turing machine and $a$ is the input string to that machine. If $TM(a)$ is defined, we say that $d$ is a \emph{description}\index{Description}. 
\end{definition}

Intuitively, a description is composed by two parts, a Turing machine that should compresses all the regularities found in this representation, and a string containing what is left, that is, the non-compressible part.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:descriptions_model}
We define the \emph{set of descriptions}\index{Set of descriptions}, denoted by $\mathcal{D}$, as:
\[
\mathcal{D} = \{ d \in \mathcal{B}^\ast : d = \langle TM,a \rangle \wedge TM(a) \downarrow \}.
\]
Let $r \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be a representation. We define the set of \emph{descriptions for $r$}, denoted by $\mathcal{D}_r$, as:
\[
\mathcal{D}_r = \{ d \in \mathcal{D} : TM(a) = r \}.
\]
Finally, given an entity $e \in \mathcal{E}$, we define the set of \emph{descriptions for $e$}, denoted by $\mathcal{D}_e$, as:
\[
\mathcal{D}_e = \{ d \in \mathcal{D} : \exists r \in \mathcal{R}_e,\, TM(a) = r \}.
\]
\end{definition}

From an otological point of view, descriptions are just string based representations that satisfy the additional requirement of being computable. In this sense, descriptions are also representations, and so, there exists descriptions that describe descriptions. In practice it is not a good idea to use descriptions as the representation of entities, since what we are looking for in a good representation is that they contain as many details as possible about the original entities, not a concise encoding. Working with descriptions in the role of representations would make the job of scientific discovery very difficult for humans.

Since each description describes one, and only one, representation, we can define a function that maps descriptions into representations. Given that descriptions are Turing machines, it is natural to use as description function a universal Turing machine. Consequently, not only the individual descriptions of representations are computable, but also the function that maps descriptions into representations is also computable.

\begin{definition}
We call \emph{description function}\index{Description function}, denoted by $\delta$, to any universal Turing machine $\delta : \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}^\ast$ that maps descriptions to their corresponding representations.
\end{definition}

If $d = \langle TM, a \rangle$ is a description of the representation $r$, then we have that $\delta \left( d \right) = \delta \left( \langle TM, a \rangle \right) = TM(a) = r$.

Inspired by the Occam's razor principle\index{Occam's razor principle}\footnote{The Occam's razor principle refers to the number of assumptions of an explanation, not to the length of the explanation itself.}, if two explanations are indifferent, we should prefer the shortest one. Therefore, the limit of what can be known (understand) about a representation, that is, its perfect model, is given by the shortest description that allows us to reconstruct this representation.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:descriptions_perfect_model}
Let $\mathcal{D}_r$ be the set of descriptions of a representaton $r \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$, and let $d \in \mathcal{D}_r$ be a description of $r$. We say that $d$ is a \emph{perfect description}\index{Perfect description} of the representation $r$ if there is no other description $d' \in\mathcal{D}_r$ such that $l(d') < l(d)$.
\end{definition}

Recall that what we know about an entity $e$ is conditional to the quality of the representation $r$ used. If the representation $r$ is wrong, we cannot reach a perfect knowledge about $e$ even if we have found the perfect description $d$ for $r$.

\begin{notation}
We donote by $d_r^{\star}$ the fact that the description $d$ is a perfect description for the representation $r$.
\end{notation}

The perfect description for a representation might not be unique, that is, there could be more than one optimal way to compute $r$.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:set_descriptions_perfect_model}
Let $\mathcal{D}_r$ be the set of descriptions of a representaton $r \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$. We define the \emph{set of perfect descriptions} for $r$, denoted by $\mathcal{D}^\star_r$, as the subset of $\mathcal{D}_r$ composed by the perfect descriptions of $r$.
\end{definition}

Unfortunately, the set of perfect descriptions of a representation is in general not known and, as Proposition \ref{prop:nescience-kolmogorov} shows, there exist no algorithm to compute it. In practice what we have to do is to use an approximation to estimate how far our current best description is from a perfect one, that is, how much we do not know about a particular representation for an entity (see Chapter \ref{chap:Redundancy}).

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:nescience-kolmogorov}
Let $r \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be a representation and $d_r^{\star}$ be a perfect description, then we have that $l \left( d_r^{\star} \right) = K\left( r \right)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Apply Definition \ref{def:Kolmogorov-Complexity} and the fact that we require that the Turing machines $TM$ used in definitions $\langle TM,a\rangle$ must be prefix-free.
\end{proof}

The actual length of a description $l \left( d \right)$ for a representation $r$ is something that depends on the particular enconding of Turing machines used. The encoding method is given by the description function $\delta$ used. Fortunately, if we replace our description function by a different one, the length of perfect models do not change (up to an additive constant that does not depend on the representations themselves).

\begin{corollary}
Let $r \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be a representation, $\delta$ and $\dot{\delta}$ two different description functions, and $d_r^{\star}$ the perfect description of the representation $r$ using $\delta$ and $\dot{d}_r^{\star}$ the perfect description using $\dot{\delta}$, then we have that $l \left( d_r^{\star} \right) \leq l \left( \dot{d}_r^{\star} \right) + c$ where $c$ is a constant that does not depend on $r$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Apply Theorem \ref{prop:nescience-kolmogorov} and Theorem \ref{def:Invariance-theorem}.
\end{proof}

In general, in the theory of nescience we are not interested in computing the actual value of the nescience about an entity given a description and a representation. Instead what we are interested is in the ordering of the different possible pairs of descriptions and representations given their nescience. In this sense, the details of the particular universal Turing machine used in practice are not relevant\footnote{Do not confuse the inner workings of the universal Turing machine that maps descriptions to representations, in which we are not interested, with the inner workings of the universal oracle Turing machine that maps representations to entities, in which we are interested, since this knowledge is critical to understand how things work.}. For the rest of this book we will assume that $\delta$ is fixed to a reference universal Turing machine. For example, in Section \ref{sub:ax_type_theory} we use as univeral Turing machine the lambda calculus. Alternatively, the reader could consider that all the theorems provided in this book that deal with the length of shortest models are valid up to an additive constant that does not depend on the topics themselves.

A remarkable consequence of Proposition \ref{prop:nescience-kolmogorov} is that perfect descriptions must be incompressible, that is, \emph{perfect knowledge implies randomness} (see Section \ref{sec:incompressibility_randomness}).

\begin{corollary}
Let $d_r^{\star}$ be the perfect description of a representation $r$, then we have that $K \left( d_r^{\star} \right) = l \left( d_r^{\star} \right)$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Having $K \left( d_r^{\star} \right) < l \left( d_r^{\star} \right)$ would be a contradiction with the fact that $d_r^{\star}$ is the shortest possible description of $r$.
\end{proof}

The converse, in general, does not hold, since we could have a random description that it is not the shortest possible one, that is, a description $d$ for a reprsentation $r$ such that $l(d) = K(d)$ but $l(d_r^{\star}) < l(d)$.

\begin{example}
\label{ex:description_neural}
We could define a deep neural network\index{Neural network} with an input layer of one thousands nodes, ten hidden layers of fifty thousands nodes each, and an output layer of one thousand nodes, and then train the network to output a fixed string of one thousand 1's for any given input string. The Kolmogorov complexity of this neural network is much higher that the complexity of a string of one thousand 1's.
\end{example}

There is little value on descriptions that are longer than the representations they describe, that is, descriptions that do not compress the representations.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:trivial_model}
Let $r \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be a representation, and $d \in \mathcal{D}_r$ one of its descriptions. If $l(d) \geq l(r)$, we say that $d$ is a \emph{pleonastic description}\index{Pleonastic description} of the representation $r$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
\label{ex:topics_models_graph}
Consider the set of all possible finite graphs\index{Graph}. Since graphs are abstract mathematical objects, we need a way to represent them as strings, for example, by using a binary encoding of their adjacency matrices (see Section \ref{sec:Graphs} for an introduction to graphs). The description $d = \langle TM, r \rangle$, where $r$ is the representation of a graph and $TM$ is a Turing machine that just halts, will be part of $\mathcal{D}_r$ since $TM(r) = r$. We are concerned about the fact that this description may not be shortest possible description of $r$.
\end{example}

It might happen that there is no shortest possible description of a representation than the representation itself. This is the case when representations are random, or incompressible, strings. And, as we have seen in Section \ref{sec:incompressibility_randomness} the overhelming majority of strings are incompressible. It is useless to do research about random representation, since it is not possible to find shorter models for that representation.

The concept of perfect description can be generalized from individual representations to entities. This generalization allow us to study the nature and properties of these entities.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:entities_perfect_model}
Let $\mathcal{D}_e$ be the set of descriptions of an entity $e \in \mathcal{E}$. We define the \emph{set of perfect descriptions} of the entity $e$, denoted by $\mathcal{D}^\star_e$ as the subset of $\mathcal{D}_e$ composed by perfect descriptions. The elements of $\mathcal{D}^\star_e$ are denoted by $d^\star_e$.
\end{definition}

If $d^\star_e \in \mathcal{D}^\star_e$ there must exits a $r \in \mathcal{R}^\star_e$ such that $d^\star_e \in \mathcal{D}^\star_r$.

An interesting case is when all the descriptions that compose $\mathcal{D}_e$ are pleonastics, that is, there is no model that it is shorter than the representation for all the possible representations of the entity. That would the case if all the representations of the entity $e$ are random strings. In this particular case, scientific research would be doomed, since it is not possible to find a suitable model for $e$. The fact that we can understand and make predictions about $e$ will be limited by the length of the non-compressible representations of $e$.

\section{Descriptions for Joint Representations}
\label{sec:description_joint_represenation}

In Section \ref{sec:descriptions_joint_topic} we introduced the concept of joint representation $ts$ of two individual representations $t$ and $s$. In this section we are interested in to study how the length of the perfect description of a joint representation relates to the length of the perfect descriptions of the individual representations.

The length of the perfect description of a joint representation is greater or equal than the length of the perfect description of the individual representations. That is, the more information we include in a representation, the longer will take to describe it. 

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:joint_length}
Let $t,s \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be two representations and $m_{t}^{\star}$, $m_{s}^{\star}$ and $m_{ts}^{\star}$ the perfect descriptions of the representatons $t$, $s$ and the joint representation $ts$ respectively. We have that $l \left( m_{ts}^{\star} \right) \geq l \left( m_{t}^{\star} \right)$ and $l \left( m_{ts}^{\star} \right) \geq l \left( m_{s}^{\star} \right)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The statement $l \left( m_{ts}^{\star} \right) \geq l \left( m_{t}^{\star} \right)$ is equivalent to $K(ts) \geq K(t)$. Then apply Proposition \ref{prop:excess_kolmogorov}.
\end{proof}

Intuitively, adding more information to a representation is a good thing if this information is relevant to describe the entity in which we are interested. But adding non-relevant information will make our model unnecessarily long. Recall that the process of joining representations can be used to concatenate two partial representations of the same entity, or to extend a representation with additional missing symbols.

If the selected representations partially overlap, we could take advantage of this redundancy to come up with a shorter join description than simply joining the individual descriptions. In the worst case, the perfect description of a joint representation would be the concatenation of the perfect descriptions of the individual representations.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:joint_sum}
Let $t,s \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be two representations and $m_{t}^{\star}$, $m_{s}^{\star}$ and $m_{ts}^{\star}$ the perfect descriptions of the representatons $t$, $s$ and the joint representation $ts$ respectively. We have that $l \left( m_{ts}^{\star} \right) \leq l \left( m_{t}^{\star} \right) + l \left( m_{s}^{\star} \right)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The statement $l \left( m_{ts}^{\star} \right) \leq l \left( m_{t}^{\star} \right) + l \left( m_{s}^{\star} \right)$ is equivalent to $K(ts) \leq K(t) + K(s)$, then apply Proposition \ref{prop:additive_kolmogorov}.
\end{proof}

{\color{red} An interpretation of Proposition \ref{prop:joint_sum} is that including redundant information in the representation of an entity is not a problem from the point of view of finding its shortest possible description. In practice, we have to use that representation that makes the process of scientific discovery (finding the best model) as easy as possible, even if this representation is unnecessarily long. In contrast, Proposition \ref{prop:joint_length} claims that adding non-relevant symbols to a representation is something that has to be avoided.}

Finally, next proposition proves that the order of the representations in the perfect description of a joint representation does not change its length.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:joint_order}
Let $t,s \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be two representations and $m_{ts}^{\star}$ and $m_{st}^{\star}$ the perfect descriptions of the joint representations $ts$ and $st$ respectively. We have that that $l \left( m_{ts}^{\star} \right) = l \left( m_{st}^{\star} \right)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The statement $l \left( m_{ts}^{\star} \right) = l \left( m_{st}^{\star} \right)$ is equivalent to $K(ts) = K(st)$, then apply Proposition \ref{prop:kolmogorov_order}.
\end{proof}

Since joining representations is not a conmutative operation, there is no way to guarantee that the strins $ts$ and $st$ encode the same entity. Note also that given the concatenated $ts$ we cannot infer the original $t$ and $s$, since they are not self-delimited strings.

Propositions \ref{prop:joint_length}, \ref{prop:joint_sum} and \ref{prop:joint_order} can be generalized to any arbitrary, but finite, collection of representations $t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n$.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:joint_multiple_topics}
Let $t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be a finite collection of representations. Then, we have that:

\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\roman{enumi}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $l(m_{t_1 t_2 \ldots t_n}^\star) \geq l(m_ {t_i}^\star) \; \forall \, 0 \leq i \leq n$,
\item $l(m_{t_1 t_2 \ldots t_n}^\star) \leq l(m_ {t_1}^\star) + l(m_ {t_2}^\star) + \ldots + l(m_ {t_n}^\star)$,
\item $l(m_{t_1 \ldots t_i \ldots t_j \ldots t_n}^\star) = l(m_{t_1 \ldots t_j \ldots t_i \ldots t_n}^\star) + c \; \forall \, 0 \leq i \leq j \leq n$,
\item $l(m_{t_1 \ldots t_{n-1}}^\star) \leq l(m_{t_1 \ldots t_{n-1} t_n}^\star)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Apply Propositions \ref{prop:joint_length}, \ref{prop:joint_sum} and \ref{prop:joint_order} to individual pairs of topics $i$ and $j$.
\end{proof}

% Section: Conditional Descriptions

\section{Conditional Descriptions}

It is usually cumbersome to include all the information needed to reconstruct an entity in its description, since that would require very large strings for the majority of the entities. It is more convenient to assume some already existing background knowledge, and compute how much we do not know about an entity given that background. In this section we are going to study the concept of \emph{conditional descriptions}, that is, computing a description given another description. Conditional descriptions also play a very important role in the discovery of new knowledge: if by conditioning a description to some prior knowledge we reduce significantly the inaccuracy of a model, that would mean this prior knowledge is relevant to understand the entity.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:conditional_description}
Let $r, d, s \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be strings. We say that the string $\langle d, s \rangle$ is a \emph{valid conditional description}\index{Conditional model} of the representation $r$ given the string $s$, denoted by $d_{r \mid s}$, if $d = \langle TM, a \rangle$ is a description, and $TM \left(\langle a, s \rangle \right) = r$.
\end{definition}

The conditional description $d_{r \mid s}$ is based on two strings $a$ and $s$, that play very different roles. The string $a$ is the input to the Turing machine $TM$,  and it should contain the non-compresible part of the representation $r$. The string $s$ should be the description, or representation, of another entity whose knowledge can helps to understand the entity in which we are interested. For example, as we will see in Chapter \ref{chap:Redundancy}, the string $s$ is not taken into account when computing the surfeit of a conditional description.

Note that the conditional description $d_{r \mid s}$ does not belong to the set of valid description $\mathcal{D}$ for the representation $r$, since $s$ is required to compute the representation $r$, but it is not part of the description itself. A new definition is required to capture this new concept.

\begin{definition}
Let $r \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be a representation and $s \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ an arbitrary string, we define the \emph{set of conditional descriptions}\index{Set of conditional descriptions} of $r$ given $s$, denoted by $\mathcal{D}_{r \mid s}$, as:
\[
\mathcal{D}_{r \mid s} = \{ d \in \mathcal{B}^\ast, d = \langle TM, a \rangle : TM \left(\langle a, s \rangle \right) = r \}.
\]
\end{definition}

For each representation $r \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ there always exists a conditional description $d_{r \mid s}$ that describes $r$, as next proposition shows.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:description_implies_conditional}
Let $r \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be a representation and $s \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ an arbitrary string. If $d \in \mathcal{D}_{r}$ then $d \in \mathcal{D}_{r \mid s}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We can use a conditional description $\langle \langle TM, a \rangle, s \rangle$ based on a Turing $TM$ machine that given the input $\langle a, s \rangle$ safely ignores the $s$ string.
\end{proof}

The converse of Proposition \ref{prop:description_implies_conditional} is not true. The fact that $d$ is a conditional description ($d \in \mathcal{D}_{r \mid s}$) does not implies that $d$ is also a description ($d \in \mathcal{D}_{r})$. We require that $TM \left(\langle a, s \rangle \right) = r$ but $TM \left( a \right) = r$ is not required, and it might not be the case.

We are interested in the concept of perfect conditional description. The perfect conditional description of a representation given a prior knowledge is the shortest possible string that allow us to fully reconstruct the representation assuming this prior knowledge.

\begin{definition}
Let $r \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be a representation, and let $d^\star_{r \mid s}$ be the shortest possible description of $r$ given the string $s$. We call $d^\star_{r \mid s}$ the \emph{perfect conditional description} of the representation $r$ given the string $s$, or perfect conditional description of $r$ given $s$ for short.
\end{definition}

Note that $d^\star_{r \mid s}$ is a perfect description of the representation $r$ conditional to the string $s$. That is, it might happen that the string $s$ is not a perfect description itself, or it is a representation that contains non-relevant symbols. In that case, we would have reached a perfect knowledge with respect to the $d$ part, but not for the $s$ part, of the combined $\langle d, s \rangle$ string.

The length of perfect conditional description is equal or shorter that their unconditional counterparts. That is, assuming some already existing background knowledge could reduce the effort required to describe a representation.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:description_conditional_inequality}
Let $r \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be a representation and $s \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ an arbitrary string. We have that $l \left( d^\star_{r \mid s} \right) \leq l \left( d^\star_r \right)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The statement $l \left( d^\star_{r \mid s} \right) \leq l \left( d^\star_r \right)$ is equivalent to $K(r \mid s) \leq K(r)$, then apply Proposition \ref{prop:kolmogorov_conditional}.
\end{proof}

Next proposition shows the relation between the lengths of descriptions, join descriptions and conditional descriptions.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:description_conditional_joint}
Let $r, s \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ two different representations. We have that:
\[
l \left( d^\star_{r \mid s} \right) \leq l \left( d^\star_r \right) \leq l \left( d^\star_{rs} \right)
\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The statement $l \left( d^\star_{r \mid s} \right) \leq l \left( d^\star_r \right) \leq l \left( d^\star_{rs} \right)$ is equivalent to $K(r | s ) \leq K(r)$ and $K(r) \leq K(rs)$, then apply Proposition \ref{prop:kolmogorov_relations}.
\end{proof}

As it was the case of joint descriptions, the concept of conditional description can be extended to finite collections of representations.

\begin{definition}
Let $r, d, s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be strings. We say that the string $\langle d, s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n \rangle$ is a \emph{valid conditional description}\index{Conditional model} of the representation $r$ given the strings $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$, denoted by $d \mid s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$, if $d = \langle TM, a \rangle$ is a description, and $TM \left(\langle a, s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n \rangle \right) = r$.
\end{definition}

In the next definition we provide the generalization of the concept of perfect conditional descriptions.

\begin{definition}
Let $r \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be a representation, and let $d^\star_{r \mid s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n}$ be the shortest possible description of $r$ given the strings $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$. We call $d^\star_{r \mid s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n}$ the \emph{perfect conditional description} of the representation $r$ given the string $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$, or perfect conditional description of $r$ given $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$ for short.
\end{definition}

Next proposition generalizes Propositions \ref{prop:description_conditional_inequality} and \ref{prop:description_conditional_joint} to any arbitrary, but finite, collection of strings $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$. Moreover, the proposition shows that the more background knowledge we assume for a representation, the shorter is the perfect description for that representation.

\begin{proposition}
Let $r, s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be a finite collection of strings. Then, we have that:
\[
l \left( d^\star_{r \mid s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n} \right) \leq l \left( d^\star_r \right) \leq l \left( d^\star_{r,s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n} \right)
\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Apply Propositions \ref{prop:description_conditional_inequality} and \ref{prop:description_conditional_joint} to individual pairs of representations $i$ and $j$.
\end{proof}

The following proposition generalizes the idea that assuming more background knowledge to a description cannot increase its length.

\begin{proposition}
Let $r, s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n, s_{n+1} \in \mathcal{B}^\ast$ be a finite collection of strings. Then, we have that:
\[
l \left( d^\star_{r \mid s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n, s_{n+1}} \right) \leq l \left( d^\star_{r \mid s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n} \right)
\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Apply Propositions \ref{prop:description_conditional_inequality} and \ref{prop:description_conditional_joint} to individual pairs of representations $i$ and $j$.
\end{proof}

\section{Research Areas}
\label{sec:areas}

Entities can be grouped into research areas. The concept of area is useful as long as all the entities included in the area are related to a common knolewdge subdomain, or share a common property. The particular details of the grouping criteria depend on the practical applications in which the theory of nescience is being used.

\begin{definition}
Given a set of entities $\mathcal{E}$, we define a \emph{research area}\index{Research area} $\mathcal{A}$ as a subset of entities $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{E}$.
\end{definition}

If we want to know how much we do not know about a research area, first we have to provide a representation for that area. In general areas are infinite, but the number of known representations is finite, and so, we can only describe the areas with respect to our current knowledge.

\begin{definition}
Let $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{E}$ be an area. We define the \emph{known subset of the area}\index{Known subset of an area} $\mathcal{A}$, denoted by $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$, as the set composed by those entities $e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n \in A$ for which at least one non-pleonastic description is known.
\end{definition}

We have to distinguish between the knowable subset of $\mathcal{A}$, composed by those entities for which there exists a representation, and the know subset of $\mathcal{A}$, composed by those entities for which we know a non-pleonastic description, that is, those entities for which somebody has already done some research about them. Of course, the set of known entities is a subset of the set of knowable entities.

As our understanding of a research area changes, the number of entities included in its known subset changes as well. The properties of areas studied in this book will be always relative to our current knowledge.

\begin{definition}
Let $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{E}$ be an area with known subset $\hat{\mathcal{A}} = \{ e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n \}$, and let  $R = \{ r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n \}$ a set of representations, such that $r_i \in \mathcal{R}_{e_i}$. We call $R_{\hat{\mathcal{A}}}$ a \emph{representation of the area $\mathcal{A}$} given the known subset $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$, abbreviated as \emph{representation of $A$}.
\end{definition}

In the same way, we can introduce the concept of description of an area.

\begin{definition}
Let $R_{\hat{\mathcal{A}}} = \{ r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n \}$ be the representation of an area $\mathcal{A}$. We call a \emph{description of the area $\mathcal{A}$} given the known subset $\hat{\mathcal{A}}$, abbreviated as \emph{description of $\mathcal{A}$}, and denoted by $d_{\hat{\mathcal{A}}}$, to any string in the form $\langle TM, a\rangle$ such that $TM(a) = \langle r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n\rangle$.
\end{definition}

We can also define the set of descriptions of an area.

\begin{definition}
Let $R_{\hat{\mathcal{A}}} = \{ r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n \}$ be the representation of an area $\mathcal{A}$. We define the set of \emph{descriptions for $R_{\hat{\mathcal{A}}}$}, denoted by $\mathcal{D}_{R_{\hat{\mathcal{A}}}}$, as:
\[
\mathcal{D}_{R_{\hat{\mathcal{A}}}} = \{ d \in \mathcal{D} : TM(a) = \langle r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n\rangle \}.
\]
\end{definition}

Finally, we are interested in the perfect model for a research area, that is, the shortest possible string that fully describes its known subset. According to Definition \ref{def:trivial_model}, if we are aware of the existence of a entity $e \in A$, that entity should be part of $\hat{A}$, even in the case we have not started yet to do research about that particular topic.

\begin{definition}
Let $A \subset \mathcal{E}$ be an area with known subset $\hat{A}$, and let $d_{\hat{A}}^{\star} \in \mathcal{M}_{\hat{A}}$ be the shortest possible description of $A$. We call  $d_{\hat{A}}^{\star}$ the \emph{perfect description of the area $A$} given the known subset $\hat{A}$\index{Perfect description of an area}, abbreviated as \emph{perfect description of $A$}.
\end{definition}

Next proposition shows the relation between the description of an area, and the descriptions of the entities that compose the known subset of that area. In general, the models for an area are different from the collection of models of the individual topics.

\begin{proposition}
Let $A \subset \mathcal{E}$ be an area with known subset $\hat{A} = \{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n\}$, then we have that $l \left( d_{\hat{A}}^{\star} \right) \leq l(d_ {e_1}^\star) + l(d_ {e_2}^\star) + \ldots + l(d_ {e_n}^\star)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Apply Proposition \ref{prop:joint_multiple_topics}-ii. 
\end{proof}

Also, as it was proved in Proposition \ref{prop:joint_multiple_topics}, the order in which the representations are listed in the description of an area is not relevant when dealing with the perfect model for that area.

Areas can overlap, that is, given two areas $A$ and $B$ it might happen that $A \cap B \neq \varnothing$. Moreover, areas can be subsets of other areas, creating an hierarchy of areas. We are interested in the length of perfect models of areas in relation to the length of perfect models of other areas.

\begin{proposition}
Let $A, B \subset \mathcal{E}$ be two areas such that $A \subset B$, and let $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ be their know subsets respectively, then we have that $l \left( d_{\hat{A}}^{\star} \right) \leq l \left( d_{\hat{B}}^{\star} \right)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
{\color{red} TODO}
\end{proof}

Next proposition \label{prop:areas_union} shows how the length of the shortest possible description of areas relate to the union and intersection of such areas.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:areas_union}
Let $A, B \subset \mathcal{E}$ be two areas with know subsets $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ respectively, then we have that $l \left( d_{\hat{A} \cup \hat{B}}^{\star} \right) = l \left( d_{\hat{A}}^{\star} \right) + l \left( d_{\hat{B}}^{\star} \right) - l \left( d_{\hat{A} \cap \hat{B}}^{\star} \right)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
{\color{red} TODO}
\end{proof}

A consequence of Proposition \label{prop:areas_union} is that $l \left( d_{\hat{A} \cup \hat{B}}^{\star} \right) \leq l \left( d_{\hat{A}}^{\star} \right) + l \left( d_{\hat{B}}^{\star} \right)$, that is, when we combines two different research areas, how much we do not know about these areas decreases.

In the same way we introduced a chain rule for entropy in Proposition \ref{prop:chain_rule_entropy}, we can provide a chain rule for the shortest length for a description of a research area.

\begin{proposition}
Let $A, B \subset \mathcal{E}$ be two areas with know subsets $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$, then we have that $l \left( d_{\hat{A} \cup \hat{B}}^{\star} \right) = l \left( d_{\hat{A}}^{\star} \right) + l \left( d_{\hat{B} \backslash \hat{A}}^{\star} \right)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
{\color{red} TODO}
\end{proof}
