## About

We celebrate knowledge, build machines of dazzling complexity, and unlock the secrets of nature. Yet the vastness of what we do not know still dwarfs our achievements. The new Theory of Nescience invites readers on a journey not through what is known, but into the very depths of ignorance itself.

At its core lies a radical idea: perfect knowledge implies randomness. From this insight emerges a rigorous mathematical framework (grounded in the principles of computability, complexity, and artificial intelligence) that enables us to measure ignorance, evaluate scientific progress, and guide research toward a deeper understanding of the unknown unknowns, the deeper mysteries we have not even imagined.

But this is not merely a theoretical pursuit. The theory presented here is not only elegant, it is practical. It offers concrete tools to confront some of the most challenging open problems in science and technology, to extract meaning from data, and to uncover discoveries beyond the reach of intuition alone.

Whether you're building advanced systems or grappling with foundational questions, this book offers a new lens for understanding how knowledge is acquired, structured, and ultimately constrained. It's not about knowing more, it's about better understanding what we don't know.

## About the Author
#### R. A. Garc√≠a Leiva

My passion is applying artificial intelligence to transform business and society in general, my focus is asking the right questions and my ambition is to bring the knowledge and technologies of the future to the present. I breathe innovation through each of the pores of my skin, with a total focus on results, and always seeking to maximize the impact of my work. I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science, a Master degree in Computational Sciences, and more than 20 years of working experience as a research engineer. Currently, I work as a Innovation Manager at Vodafone. When I'm not too busy changing the world, I like to walk in nature with my family, read a good book, or watch a documentary.
