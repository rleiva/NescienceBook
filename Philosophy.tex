The \emph{philosophy of science}\index{Philosophy of science} is the branch of philosophy that examines the foundations, methods, and implications of scientific inquiry. It explores how scientific knowledge is generated, the validity of scientific theories, the nature of scientific reasoning, and the role of values in science. By addressing fundamental questions about objectivity, reality, and the limits of scientific explanation, the philosophy of science helps us understand how science works and its impact on our understanding of the world.

The philosophy of science provides a theoretical framework for analyzing the core elements that constitute our theory of nescience. It enables us to critically examine the foundations and assumptions of our theory, guiding us toward the identification of the essential questions that we must address. Moreover, philosophical inquiry compels us to rigorously push the boundaries of our analysis, ensuring that our theory is explored to its ultimate consequences, both logically and conceptually. This approach strengthens the robustness of the theory, even if these results do not directly translate into practical applications.

A central theme in scientific methodology is the distinction between \emph{discovery} and \emph{justification}. Discovery refers to how new ideas or hypotheses emerge, often through creativity, intuition, or serendipity, while justification involves the use of evidence and logical reasoning to evaluate and validate these ideas. Philosophers of science have historically emphasized justification, focusing on methods to rigorously test and analyze scientific claims. However, both discovery and justification are critical to understanding scientific progress, and this chapter will address both aspects.

In this chapter, we provide a concise overview of key elements from the philosophy of science, as well as relevant concepts from other branches of philosophy, such as metaphysics, epistemology, and ontology, that are important to the theory of nescience. Certain other topics within the philosophy of science, such as the problem of objectivity (examining whether science can be truly objective or is influenced by social and personal values) or the role of values in science, including the relationship between ethical, social, and political values and scientific practices, are not included in this review, as they are not directly relevant to a mathematical theory of nescience.

The chapter begins with a brief introduction to the field and its importance in understanding scientific inquiry. We delve into the problem of which entities can be known, examining the scope of scientific knowledge and the nature of observable and unobservable phenomena. The chapter also addresses the concept of scientific representation, discussing how models, theories, and laws reflect aspects of reality. We examine how science discovers new knowledge, the principles behind the scientific method, and the various ways in which scientists formulate and test hypotheses. Finally, we explore the limits of science, considering the boundaries of what science can explain and where its explanatory power may fall short.

\section{What is Science}

\emph{Science}\index{Science} is a systematic method of investigating the world around us, aimed at generating reliable knowledge through observation and reasoning. Unlike other forms of inquiry, science is rooted in the idea that knowledge must be based on evidence that can be tested and verified. By combining theoretical thinking with empirical data, science offers a powerful way to explain, predict, and understand natural phenomena. Sometimes science seeks explanations for practical purposes, but other times it is sought simply to satisfy our intellectual curiosity.

The \emph{scientific method}\index{Scientific method} is understood as the systematic process by which science acquires new knowledge. In schools, the scientific method is often taught as a series of steps: first observing and describing a phenomenon, then coming up with a hypothesis to explain it, testing that hypothesis through experiments, analyzing the results, and finally making a conclusion. However, the idea of a single, universal scientific method that can be applied to all sciences isn’t widely accepted anymore. Instead, scientists and philosophers recognize that different scientific fields require different methods because each field faces its own challenges and complexities.

The following is a list of the key features that make science distinct and valuable as a way of knowing.

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{Empiricism}\index{Empiricism}: At its core, science is an empirical endeavor, meaning it relies on observation, experimentation, and measurable evidence to understand the natural world. Scientific knowledge is grounded in data that can be gathered through direct or indirect observation, ensuring that claims can be tested and verified by others.

\item \emph{Testability}\index{Testability}: A key characteristic of science is its focus on developing testable hypotheses, that is, statements or predictions that can be empirically investigated. This means that scientific claims must be falsifiable, open to potential disproof if the evidence does not support them. This distinguishes science from fields that rely on unfalsifiable or speculative claims.

\item \emph{Theoretical Frameworks}\index{Theoretical framework}: Science is not merely about collecting facts; it seeks to develop broader explanations through models, laws, and theories. Models offer simplified representations of complex systems, while theories are well-supported frameworks that explain the underlying mechanisms of phenomena. These frameworks help interpret data and guide further investigation, offering coherence to the body of scientific knowledge.

\item \emph{Self-Correction}\index{Self-correction}: A defining feature of science is its self-correcting nature. Scientific theories are not static; they evolve as new evidence comes to light. When new data contradicts a theory, science adapts, modifies, refines, or sometimes discards the theory in favor of one that better fits the evidence. This continuous process of revision ensures that scientific knowledge becomes more accurate over time.

\item \emph{Generalizability}\index{Generalizability}: Science strives to uncover universal principles that apply across various contexts, not just to isolated cases. While science begins with specific observations, its goal is to identify general laws and patterns that explain a broad range of phenomena. This pursuit of generalizable knowledge allows science to predict future occurrences and provide deeper insights into the workings of the natural world.

\end{itemize}

The main task of the philosophy of science is to understand how techniques such as experimentation, observation, and theory building enable scientists to discover the secrets of nature. The philosophy of science draws on other areas of philosophy, such as ontology, epistemology, metaphysics, and logic. \emph{Ontology}\index{Ontology}, the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of existence, addresses the question of which entities exist in the real world. It examines the types of entities that science can study, whether they are observable, abstract, or indeterminate, and engages with the philosophical debates surrounding their existence. Ontology provides the foundation for exploring the boundaries of scientific knowledge and the limits of inquiry. \emph{Epistemology}\index{Epistemology} is the branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge itself—how we acquire it, what justifies it, and what its limits are. While ontology deals with what exists, epistemology addresses how we come to know what exists. In the context of science, epistemology examines the methods, evidence, and reasoning that underpin scientific investigation, exploring how scientific knowledge is built, how reliable it is, and what counts as a justified belief in scientific practice. Both ontology and epistemology are part of the broader field of \emph{metaphysics}\index{Metaphysics}, which deals with the fundamental nature of reality and existence. Metaphysics explores the most basic concepts and categories of being, such as time, space, causality, and possibility, as well as the relationship between mind and matter. \emph{Logic}\index{Logic}, the study of valid reasoning, underpins the entire scientific enterprise by providing the tools to analyze arguments, identify fallacies, and structure sound reasoning. In science, logic is used to ensure the coherence of theoretical frameworks, the validity of inferences drawn from data, and the consistency of explanations and predictions. Formal logic, including propositional and predicate logic, provides a systematic way to evaluate arguments and detect errors, while informal logic addresses reasoning in everyday scientific discourse. Together, ontology, epistemology, metaphysics, and logic provide a comprehensive philosophical foundation for understanding what science studies, how it builds knowledge, and the fundamental nature of the reality science seeks to explain.

This chapter on philosophy of science is structured around key components that illustrate how scientific knowledge is developed and justified (see Figure \ref{fig:chapter-organization}). It begins with a discussion on \emph{Entities}, which can be either concrete or abstract, representing the objects of scientific study. From these entities, knowledge is acquired through \emph{Observation}, which involves gathering empirical data and facts. These observations are then transformed into \emph{Representations}, such as recorded data, or facts, that scientists use to analyze and interpret phenomena. Through the process of \emph{Discovery}, these representations lead to the formulation of \emph{Explanations}, which take the form of scientific \emph{theories and laws} that describe underlying principles governing the natural world. The chapter also explores how scientific explanations influence future observations, shaping what is investigated and how data is interpreted. Additionally, thought Experiments provide an alternative way of reasoning about scientific problems beyond direct empirical observation. Finally, the chapter addresses \emph{Justification}, emphasizing the criteria by which scientific claims are validated, ensuring that discoveries and explanations are robust, reliable, and well-supported by evidence. This structure provides a comprehensive view of the scientific process, from the identification of entities to the formation and justification of scientific theories.

\section{What is an Entity}
\label{sec:what-is-an-entity}

In this section, we focus on the fundamental problem of determining which kinds of entities can be known or investigated by science.

A \emph{knowable entity}\index{Knowable entity} is an object, phenomenon, or concept that can be investigated, understood, or described through scientific or intellectual inquiry. Knowable entities are those that, either directly or indirectly, can be observed, measured, inferred, or modeled, using available tools, methods, or theories. They are within the scope of human knowledge, and their properties can be analyzed or explained. Examples of knowable entities include the stars and plantes, animals, or computer algorithms. A \emph{non-knowable entity}\index{Non-knowable entity} refers to something that cannot be directly observed, measured, or understood using current scientific or intellectual methods. This could be due to limitations in technology, the abstract or metaphysical nature of the entity, or inherent epistemological boundaries. Non-knowable entities might remain beyond the reach of human understanding either temporarily (until methods evolve) or permanently (due to their nature). Examples of non-knowable entities include the nature of consciousness, the origin of the universe, or the existence of a deity. The distinction between knowable and non-knowable entities is not always fixed, but varies depending on the clarity and precision of the area of interest and the evolving nature of scientific understanding in each field.

{\color{red} Extend uknowable to consider existing by unknowable and unknowability due to inexistence}

Scientific research encompasses both \emph{concrete entities}\index{Concrete entities} and \emph{abstract entities}\index{Abstract entities}. Concrete entities refer to physical objects or phenomena that can be directly observed, measured, or interacted with, such as stars, cells, or chemical compounds. These entities form the basis of empirical research, where data is collected through direct observation or experimentation. In contrast, abstract entities are conceptual and do not have a physical presence, such as numbers, algorithms, or theoretical models. Abstract entities play a crucial role in scientific research, particularly in fields like mathematics and theoretical physics, where they provide the framework for understanding and modeling concrete phenomena. While abstract entities cannot be observed directly, they can be known through indirect methods. The inclusion of these abstract entities in scientific inquiry raises important philosophical questions about their ontological status: Are these abstract entities real in the same way that physical objects are, or are they simply conceptual tools? This question remains an open and debated issue in the philosophy of science.

Finally, in scientific inquiry, there is also a distinction between \emph{observable entities}\index{Observable entities}, which can be directly perceived or measured, and \emph{non-observable entities}\index{Non-observable entities}, which cannot be directly observed but can still be detected or inferred from empirical evidence. Observable entities include things like trees, planets, and bacteria, objects that can be seen or measured using scientific instruments. Non-observable, but still detectable, entities include things like subatomic particles and gravitational forces. These entities are often crucial for explaining observable phenomena and are identified through the use of scientific instruments and theoretical frameworks. For example, we cannot observe a quark in the same way we observe a tree, but through scientific theory, experimentation, and the detection of indirect evidence, we infer its existence.

A central debate within the scope of science is the tension between \emph{reductionism}\index{Reductionism} and \emph{holism}\index{Holism}. Reductionism is the view that complex systems can be fully understood by breaking them down into their simplest, most fundamental parts. For example, a reductionist might argue that biological processes can be explained entirely by chemistry, and chemistry by physics. This approach assumes that understanding the smallest components of a system will provide a complete explanation of the whole. In contrast, holism argues that some phenomena cannot be fully understood by reducing them to their components. Instead, the whole system exhibits properties that cannot be predicted or explained by analyzing its parts in isolation. For example, in ecology, the interactions within an ecosystem can produce emergent properties that are not reducible to the behavior of individual species.

Finally, the scope of science is shaped by the debate between \emph{scientific realism}\index{Realism} and \emph{anti-realism}\index{Anti-realism}, which addresses the question of whether the entities posited by scientific theories are real or merely useful constructs. The contrast between realism and anti-realism is most marked for sciences which make claims about non-observable entities. Scientific realism holds that the entities described by scientific theories exist independently of our knowledge of them. According to this view, successful scientific theories reveal truths about the world. In contrast, anti-realism argues that scientific theories are useful tools for predicting and organizing observations, but we should not necessarily believe that non-observable entities like electrons or gravitational waves are real. For anti-realists, the purpose of science is not to describe an independent reality, but rather to provide models that help us navigate and predict phenomena.

Scientists often seek to classify the objects they study into general kinds or categories. A key goal of classification is to convey meaningful information, enabling us to better understand and navigate the complexities of the natural world. However, this process raises several intriguing philosophical questions. Do the categories used in science represent real, essential divisions in nature, or are they merely human-made constructs designed to impose order on a complex and often ambiguous reality (realism vs. anti-realism)? Since any set of objects can, in principle, be classified in various ways, how should we determine the most appropriate approach? Is there a 'correct' way to classify, or are all classification systems fundamentally arbitrary? Some philosophers argue that \emph{natural kinds}\index{Natural kinds}, groups that correspond to divisions genuinely existing in the world, do exist, as opposed to merely reflecting human interests. Understanding whether and how such natural kinds exist can provide valuable insights into the structure of reality and inform scientific inquiry.

\section{Observation in Science}

Scientific knowledge has traditionally been granted a special epistemic status, in part because it is thought to rest on a secure foundation of solid facts firmly established by observation. On this view, facts are taken to be direct, theory-independent deliverances of the senses, immediately accessible to any careful and unprejudiced observer. They are assumed to precede theory and to provide a firm and reliable basis upon which scientific knowledge can be built.

However, there are compelling reasons to question the straightforwardness and security of facts acquired by observation and experiment. What an observer perceives when viewing an object or scene is not determined solely by the images projected onto the retina. Rather, perception is shaped by the observer’s prior experience, knowledge, and expectations. One must "clearn" to be a competent observer in science, and the perceptual experience of an expert is often markedly different from that of an untrained novice faced with the same situation. This observation challenges a literal understanding of the claim that facts are simply given via the senses. Even when multiple observers view the same scene from the same vantage point, they may interpret what they see in different ways.

Before an observer can formulate and assent to an observation statement, they must already possess an appropriate conceptual framework and know how to apply it. Observation statements presuppose considerable background knowledge. Our search for relevant facts is guided by our current state of knowledge, and this does not undermine the idea that knowledge should ultimately be grounded in facts confirmed by observation. However, it does mean that if the knowledge providing the categories through which we interpret our observations is flawed, the resulting observation statements will be similarly flawed. Judgments about what counts as an observable fact depend on the background of knowledge against which they are made. Indeed, scientific revolutions involve not only the progressive transformation of scientific theories but also a reconfiguration of what are regarded as the observable facts themselves.

This leads to the recognition that facts are fallible and subject to correction. Perceptions are influenced by the expectations and prior knowledge of the observer, so what appears as a straightforward fact to one person may not be so to another. Judgments about the truth of observation statements depend on what is already known or assumed, rendering observable facts as fallible as the presuppositions that underlie them. Everyday observation is far from passive: observers perform numerous actions, often automatically or unconsciously, to establish the validity of what they perceive. To serve as a foundation for scientific knowledge, observation statements must be formulated in ways that allow their validity to be tested through routine, objective procedures that minimize the need for subjective judgment.

Observations that can function as a basis for science must therefore be both objective and fallible. They are objective to the extent that they can be publicly tested by straightforward procedures, and they are fallible to the extent that they may be overturned by new tests enabled by advances in science and technology. Moreover, science does not require just any facts, but relevant facts. What counts as relevant depends on the current state of development of a science. The world around us involves many interwoven processes that are difficult to disentangle through mere observation of naturally occurring events. To obtain facts relevant for identifying and characterizing particular processes, it is generally necessary to intervene practically: to conduct experiments designed to isolate the process under investigation and eliminate the influence of other processes. If there are facts that constitute the foundation of science, they come primarily in the form of experimental results rather than unstructured observational data.

Yet experimental results are themselves far from straightforwardly given. Their production involves complex practical work, technical know-how, trial and error, and the exploitation of available technologies. Judgments about their adequacy are not simple either: experimental results can be faulty if the knowledge informing their design or interpretation is flawed. They can become obsolete as technology advances, can be rejected when new understanding reveals an experimental set-up to be inadequate, or can be ignored as irrelevant after theoretical shifts. Like observation statements, experimental results are fallible and revisable. Furthermore, they must not only be adequate but also significant: what counts as an adequate or significant experiment depends heavily on the prevailing theoretical and practical context. All experiments presuppose the truth of some theories to judge whether the set-up is appropriate and the instruments are providing the intended readings.

This recognition has led to attempts to formalize the relationship between scientific knowledge and the facts on which it rests. The empiricists maintained that all knowledge should be derived from ideas implanted in the mind through sense perception, while the positivists developed a broader conception of what counts as a fact. Logical positivists, in particular, sought to rigorously analyze the logical structure of the relationship between scientific knowledge and the observational and experimental facts that are thought to underpin it.

In sum, while observation plays a crucial role in science, its role is more complex and less direct than traditionally assumed. Observational and experimental facts are not simply given; they are theory-laden, constructed through skilled practice, and embedded within conceptual frameworks. They provide a fallible yet indispensable foundation for scientific knowledge, one that must continually be tested, refined, and sometimes replaced as science advances.

\section{Scientific Representation}
\label{sec:scientific_representation}

Science helps us understand the natural world by using different kinds of representations of research entities. These representations include measurements from scientific instruments, descriptions of observations, digital images like X-rays or MRI scans, and more. Scientific practice also often considers mathematical equations, models, and theoretical constructs as valid forms of representation. The challenge of \emph{scientific representation}\index{Scientific representation} is to identify the conditions that make a representation scientific and determine what makes an effective representation. The main issues discussed in this area of philosophy include:

\emph{Scientific Representation Problem}: The scientific representation problem is about figuring out the necessary and sufficient conditions that make a representation valid in science. It explores whether these conditions are the same across all scientific fields or if they vary depending on the discipline or research context. For example, what qualifies as a valid representation in physics, which often uses mathematical models, might be different from what is used in biology, where visual and descriptive representations are common. This problem also questions whether scientific representations need to be adapted to specific research goals to be considered valid.

\emph{Representational Demarcation Problem}\index{Representational demarcation}: The representational demarcation problem looks at whether scientific representations are fundamentally different from other kinds of representations, like those found in art or everyday life. It examines what makes scientific representations unique, focusing on their purpose, accuracy, and the methods used to create them. Unlike artistic representations, which may emphasize subjective interpretation or aesthetic value, scientific representations are generally held to standards of precision, reliability, and empirical adequacy. Understanding these differences helps clarify the specific role that scientific representations play in knowledge production.

\emph{Problem of Style}\index{Problem of style}: The problem of style addresses the fact that the same entity can be represented in different ways, depending on the goals and methods of the research. Different styles of representation—such as diagrams, mathematical equations, physical models, or computer simulations—each have unique characteristics, including the intended audience, level of abstraction, and type of information conveyed. This issue also asks whether these styles are fixed or if new styles can be invented to meet emerging scientific needs. The flexibility of representation styles is crucial because it allows for new insights and different ways of understanding scientific phenomena.

\emph{Standard of Accuracy}\index{Standard of accuracy}: The standard of accuracy problem is about determining what makes a scientific representation accurate. It involves figuring out how to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate representations by considering factors like how well the representation matches empirical data, captures important features of the phenomenon, and its ability to make predictions. This issue also explores whether accuracy should be seen as an objective standard or if it depends on the specific aims and context of the research. For example, a simplified model might still be considered accurate if it effectively serves its purpose, such as making predictions or providing explanations.

\emph{Problem of Ontology}\index{Problem of ontology}: The problem of ontology in scientific representation deals with the nature of the entities that can serve as representations. It asks whether representations need to be concrete, like physical models or graphs, or if they can also be abstract, like mathematical equations or theoretical constructs. This issue also questions whether representations must be realistic or if more abstract, idealized forms can still be effective in scientific inquiry. Understanding these ontological aspects helps define the types of entities that are allowed in scientific discourse and how they relate to the real-world phenomena they represent.

There are also five conditions of adequacy that a scientific representation should satisfy to be considered effective and reliable:

\emph{Requirement of Directionality}\index{Requirement of directionality}: The requirement of directionality examines the relationship between representations and the real world. Representations are meant to describe entities in the real world, but this condition raises the question of how, if at all, real-world entities might describe their representations. It challenges us to think about the direction of influence between the representation and the entity it aims to depict.

\emph{Surrogative Reasoning}\index{Surrogative reasoning}: Surrogative reasoning addresses how scientific representations allow researchers to generate hypotheses about the entities they represent. This condition explores how using a representation as a surrogate can lead to new insights or predictions about the target, effectively using the representation to stand in for the real-world entity during reasoning and analysis.

\emph{Applicability of Mathematics}\index{Applicability of mathematics}: The applicability of mathematics condition is concerned with how mathematical models can be used to represent the real world. It questions how abstract mathematical constructs can effectively describe complex physical systems and whether the success of mathematical representation depends on any special features of the target phenomena. This condition highlights the central role of mathematics in developing and understanding scientific theories.

\emph{Possibility of Misrepresentation}\index{Possibility of misrepresentation}: The possibility of misrepresentation addresses whether representations that are not fully accurate can still be considered valid scientific representations. It considers situations where simplifications or approximations are necessary and whether these less-than-perfect representations can still contribute valuable understanding of a phenomenon. This condition is important for understanding how idealizations and abstractions function in scientific practice.

\emph{Targetless Models}\index{Targetless models}: The targetless models condition explores whether we can allow representations that do not have a direct real-world counterpart. It questions if a model that does not represent any existing entity can still be useful in scientific inquiry, perhaps as a way to explore theoretical possibilities or to understand potential scenarios. This condition emphasizes the creative and exploratory aspects of scientific modeling.

There have been multiple proposals to formally define the concept of scientific representation. Unfortunately, none of these proposals can provide a convincing answer to the questions and conditions of adequacy described above. In the rest of this section, we describe some of these proposals, identifying their advantages and drawbacks. To compare these proposals, we will present them as: "A scientific model $M$ represents a target system $T$ if, and only if ...".

\emph{Stipulative Fiat}\index{Stipulative fiat}: The stipulative fiat proposal states that "a scientific model $M$ represents a target system $T$ if, and only if, a scientist stipulates that $M$ represents $T$." The main problem with this interpretation is that, since anything can be a representation if a scientist says so, it is difficult to guarantee the surrogative reasoning condition. If any model can be deemed a representation by simple stipulation, it becomes challenging to determine which representations are genuinely useful for making scientific inferences. Proponents of this theory acknowledge that while all representations may be stipulated, some are undeniably more useful than others.

\emph{Similarity Conception}\index{Similarity conception}: The similarity conception proposes that "a scientific model $M$ represents $T$ if, and only if, $M$ and $T$ are similar." This conception addresses the surrogative reasoning condition since similarity between the model and the target allows us to derive similar properties. However, it introduces new challenges, particularly regarding the problem of style. The concept of similarity is often vague: in what sense are $M$ and $T$ similar? This vagueness can lead to issues with directionality and accuracy, as different aspects of similarity may not always align with what is relevant for scientific representation.

\emph{Structuralist Conception}\index{Structuralist conception}: The structuralist conception is based on the idea of isomorphism. According to this view, a scientific model $M$ represents a target system $T$ if the structure of $M$ is isomorphic to the structure of $T$. In other words, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements and relationships in both $M$ and $T$. This approach justifies surrogative reasoning because having the same structure implies that properties and relations in the model correspond to those in the target. Furthermore, since mathematics is fundamentally concerned with the study of structures, this conception also supports the applicability of mathematics in representing natural systems.

\emph{Inferential Conception}\index{Inferential conception}: The inferential conception proposes that a model $M$ is an epistemic representation of a target $T$ if, and only if, the user adopts an interpretation of $M$ in terms of $T$. This view emphasizes the role of the user in giving meaning to the model, suggesting that representation is not an inherent property of the model itself but arises through its use in making inferences about the target system. This conception underscores the importance of context and interpretation in determining whether a model effectively represents its target.

\emph{Fiction View of Models}\index{Fiction view of models}: According to the fiction view of models, $M$ represents $T$ if and only if $M$ functions as a prop in a game of make-believe that prescribes imagining certain things about $T$. This view draws an analogy between scientific modeling and storytelling, where models are treated as fictional constructs that facilitate imaginative engagement with the target system. Although this approach highlights the creative aspects of modeling, it raises questions about how such fictional constructs can be rigorously linked to real-world entities.

\emph{Representation-As}\index{Representation-as}: The representation-as approach suggests that a scientific model represents a target system as something, emphasizing that representation involves highlighting certain features of the target while downplaying others. This conception focuses on the interpretive aspect of modeling, where the modeler selects specific attributes of the target to represent, depending on the research goals. This approach allows for a flexible understanding of representation that can accommodate different styles and purposes, but it also implies that the usefulness of a representation is contingent on how well the modeler captures the relevant aspects of the target.

Each proposal has its strengths and weaknesses, highlighting the complexity of what it means for a model to effectively represent a target in scientific inquiry. Understanding these various perspectives is crucial for advancing our comprehension of the role of representation in science.

\section{Scientific Discovery}

Scientific discovery refers to the process through which new knowledge, ideas, or principles are uncovered within science. Unlike the systematic procedures associated with justification, discovery often involves creativity, intuition, and inspiration. While some discoveries arise from planned experiments or systematic observation, others occur unexpectedly, challenging existing paradigms or opening new fields of inquiry. The general agreement among philosophers is that the creative process of conceiving a new idea is a non-rational process that cannot be formalized as a set of steps. Understanding discovery is crucial for appreciating how science evolves and adapts, as it reveals the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of scientific progress.

The following two proposals assume that a domain-neutral logic of discovery can be formalized, offering attempts to develop such a framework.

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{Discovery as abduction}\index{Abductive reasoning}: Abductive reasoning is a mode of discovery that begins with surprising or anomalous phenomena and seeks to generate plausible hypotheses to explain them. This process is conceptualized as follows: (i) some unexpected data, such as $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, is encountered; (ii) these data would be less surprising if a hypothesis of type $H$ were true; and (iii) therefore, there is justification to develop a hypothesis of type $H$. Two types of abduction are distinguished: \emph{selective abduction}, which involves choosing from known hypotheses, and \emph{creative abduction}, which generates entirely new hypotheses. Abduction present some limitations. First, multiple hypotheses may explain the same phenomena, making additional criteria necessary to evaluate their merit. Second, the schema of abductive reasoning does not account for the act of conceiving a hypothesis itself.

\item \emph{Heuristic programming}\index{Heuristic programming} is a computational approach designed to simulate and assist the creative aspects of human problem-solving. These programs operate as searches within a defined problem space, which includes all possible configurations for a given domain. Each configuration represents a specific state within the problem space, with two key states being the initial state, the starting point of the search, and the goal state, which represents the desired outcome. Operators define the moves that transition between states, while path constraints limit permissible moves within the problem space. Problem-solving in this context involves finding a sequence of operations that connects the initial state to the goal state. The core aim of this approach is to develop heuristics (practical rules or strategies) to efficiently navigate and solve complex problems. Heuristic programming has its limitations, scientific problem spaces are often ill-defined, and computer programs rely on experimental data, meaning that simulations frequently cover only specific aspects of scientific discovery.

\end{itemize}

Many philosophers argue that discovery is an important topic within the philosophy of science, even as they move away from the idea of a formal logic of discovery. A highly influential perspective is Thomas Kuhn's examination of how new facts and theories emerge in the so-called \emph{paradigm shifts}\index{Paradigm shift}. According to Kuhn, discovery is not a single event but rather a complex and prolonged process that often results in paradigm shifts. Paradigms consist of shared generalizations, theoretical commitments, values, and exemplars that unify a scientific community and shape its research practices. During periods of normal science, research focuses on expanding and refining the existing paradigm rather than pursuing novelty. Discovery typically begins with the recognition of anomalies—phenomena that defy the expectations established by the current paradigm. This process includes observing and conceptualizing the anomaly, followed by revising the paradigm to accommodate it. During paradigm crises, theory-driven discoveries may occur as scientists propose speculative theories, develop new expectations, and conduct experiments or observations to test these ideas. Ultimately, a new paradigm emerges, transforming the once-anomalous phenomena into standard expectations.

Scientific discovery can be also viewed as inherently tied to creativity, with philosophers drawing from cognitive science, neuroscience, computational research, and environmental and social psychology to better understand how new ideas emerge. This perspective aims to demystify the mental processes behind creative thought, emphasizing that scientific creativity can be analyzed and understood philosophically. Central to this analysis are two pivotal cognitive mechanisms: analogies and mental models, which serve as fundamental tools in the generation of innovative ideas and the advancement of knowledge.

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{Analogy}\index{Analogy}: Analogies play a crucial role in scientific discovery by enabling the transfer of ideas from one domain to another. Philosophers distinguish between three types of analogies: positive, negative, and neutral. Positive analogies involve properties that are shared by both the model (the well-understood domain) and the target domain (the new domain). Negative analogies include properties that belong solely to the model and do not apply to the target domain. Neutral analogies are the most intriguing because they consist of properties whose relevance to the target domain remains uncertain. These neutral analogies are significant as they often lead to new insights and hypotheses about the less familiar domain. Additionally, there is a distinction between horizontal and vertical analogies. Horizontal analogies connect two domains at the same level of abstraction, whereas vertical analogies involve relationships between different levels of abstraction within the same domain.

\item \emph{Model-based reasoning}\index{Model-based reasoning}: The concept of model-based reasoning suggests that much of human thought, including probabilistic and causal reasoning as well as problem-solving, relies on mental models rather than formal logic or strict methodological rules. In this approach, the mind constructs structural representations of real-world or imagined situations and manipulates these models to explore possibilities and generate insights. Conceptual structures are viewed as models, and conceptual innovation involves creating new models using various operations. Analogical reasoning, or analogical modeling, is one of the primary forms of model-based reasoning, alongside visual modeling and simulative modeling, such as through experiments.

% Scientific Explaination

\section{Scientific Explaination}

In philosophy of science it is often made the assumption that there exists a single, distinct type of explanation that qualifies as "scientific." The concept of "scientific explanation" suggests at least two key elements: first, a contrast between explanations characteristic of science and those that are not, and second, a contrast between "explanations" and other forms of discourse, such as mere "descriptions." It is important to note that a set of claims can be true, accurate, and supported by evidence while still failing to qualify as explanatory.

Good scientific explanations are typically evaluated based on several key characteristics. While different philosophical frameworks might emphasize different criteria, the following characteristics are broadly agreed upon:

\emph{Empirical Adequacy}\index{Empirical adequacy}: A good explanation must align with observed and experimental evidence. It should accurately describe the phenomena being explained, providing a detailed account of how the observed data supports the explanation. Additionally, it should integrate well with existing empirical findings, ensuring reliability and fostering broader scientific understanding.

\emph{Logical Coherence}\index{Logical coherence}: The explanation should be logically consistent and free of contradictions. Its components should interconnect in a structured and harmonious way, enabling clear and valid reasoning. This coherence ensures that the explanation aligns with established logical principles and provides a solid foundation for understanding the phenomena under investigation.

\emph{Causal Relevance}\index{Causal relevance}: Good explanations often identify the causal mechanisms responsible for the phenomenon. They should clarify how and why the phenomenon occurs, detailing the specific interactions and processes involved. By establishing a clear causal link, these explanations provide a framework for understanding not just what happens, but the underlying reasons and mechanisms driving the event. This depth of causality enables predictions, interventions, and broader scientific application.

\emph{Generality}: Explanations that apply to a broader range of phenomena are considered more valuable. They should transcend individual instances to reveal patterns or principles that connect seemingly disparate phenomena. By addressing a wider scope, such explanations enhance our ability to generalize knowledge, foster predictive accuracy, and provide a unifying perspective across different domains of inquiry.

\emph{Simplicity (Parsimony)}\index{Parsimony}: A good explanation should not be unnecessarily complex. Among competing explanations, the one that makes the fewest assumptions while still accounting for the phenomena is often preferred (Occam’s Razor). This principle emphasizes clarity and efficiency in reasoning, ensuring that explanations avoid superfluous details or unwarranted complexity. Simpler explanations are easier to test, communicate, and apply, fostering a more practical and streamlined understanding of the phenomena.

\emph{Explanatory Depth}\index{Explanatory depth}: Good explanations go beyond surface descriptions to provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms, principles, or causes. They delve into the fundamental elements that drive the phenomenon, offering insights into its origins and interconnections with related concepts. By unraveling these deeper layers, such explanations help uncover not just the "how," but the "why," enriching our comprehension and enabling a more profound application of knowledge.

\emph{Testability}: The explanation must allow for predictions that can be tested and potentially falsified. This criterion ensures that the explanation is scientifically meaningful and subject to empirical scrutiny. By being testable, the explanation invites rigorous examination and challenges, which help to confirm its validity or expose its weaknesses. Testability also connects scientific explanations to the broader experimental process, enabling continuous refinement and adaptation in light of new evidence, thereby fostering scientific progress and reliability.

\emph{Unification}: A good explanation often unifies disparate phenomena under a single framework or theory, showing how they are related. It highlights the connections and underlying principles that bring coherence to seemingly unrelated phenomena. By doing so, unification not only simplifies our understanding but also enhances the explanatory power of a theory, allowing for a more integrated and comprehensive perspective on the natural world.

\emph{Use of Laws}: Good explanations often incorporate established scientific laws or theories to provide a robust foundation for their claims. By grounding explanations in well-established principles, they ensure credibility and consistency with the broader scientific framework. This approach not only strengthens the explanatory power of the claims but also facilitates their integration into existing knowledge systems, thereby fostering coherence, predictability, and utility in advancing scientific understanding.

\emph{Practical Applicability}: In some cases, the usefulness of an explanation in solving problems, guiding further research, or applying knowledge in practical ways adds to its value. An explanation with practical applicability not only enhances theoretical understanding but also bridges the gap between abstract knowledge and real-world implementation. It can inform decision-making, inspire technological innovations, and address pressing societal challenges. By demonstrating utility in diverse contexts, such explanations underscore the relevance of scientific inquiry to everyday life and future advancements.

\emph{Asymmetry}: The requirement of asymmetry in scientific explanation is a widely discussed topic in the philosophy of science. According to most philosophical accounts, explanation is indeed considered to be an asymmetric relation, meaning that if X explains Y, it should not also be true that Y explains  X under the same laws and additional facts. However, there are debates and complications surrounding this idea. Let’s examine the arguments for and against asymmetry in scientific explanations.

\emph{Explanation as prediction}: When we provide a covering law explanation for a phenomenon, the laws and specific facts we reference could have allowed us to predict the phenomenon's occurrence. This highlights that a scientific explanation is inherently a potential prediction. Conversely, every reliable prediction is inherently a potential explanation, illustrating that explanation and prediction are structurally symmetric in their foundational principles.

The following paragraphs briefly introduce the most relevant proposals to characterize what is a scientific explanation.

The \emph{Deductive-Nomological model}\index{Deductive-Nomological model}, or DN model, emphasizes the importance of deductive reasoning and general laws. According to this model, a phenomenon is explained by demonstrating how it logically follows from a general law combined with specific initial conditions. This explanation comprises two main components: the \emph{explanans}\index{explanans}, which includes the general laws and initial conditions, and the \emph{explanandum}\index{explanandum}, which is the phenomenon to be explained. For the explanation to be valid, the explanans must be true and logically entail (see logical deduction at Section \ref{sec:scientific_justification}) the explanandum, meaning the phenomenon can be deduced from the laws and conditions provided. A DN model answers the question "Why did the explanandum occur?" by showing that the phenomenon resulted from specific circumstances $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_i$, in conjunction with laws $L_1, L_2, \ldots, L_j$. For example, the motion of a particular pendulum can be explained by applying Newton's laws of motion (general laws) along with specific details such as the pendulum's length and initial displacement (specific initial conditions). Alternatively, the general behavior of pendulums can also be explained using the same laws and reasoning, since the DN model can be applied to both particular occurrences and general patterns.

The \emph{Statistical-Relevance model}\index{Statistical-Relevance model}, or SR model focuses on explaining phenomena through statistical relationships rather than strict deductive reasoning. Unlike the Deductive-Nomological model, which requires logical entailment from general laws, the SR model emphasizes the identification of statistically relevant factors that significantly influence the likelihood of a phenomenon. In this model, given some class or population \( A \), an attribute \( C \) is \emph{statistically relevant}\index{Statistical relevance} to another attribute \( B \) if and only if \( P(B | A, C) \neq P(B | A) \). This means that \( C \) affects the probability of \( B \) within the context of \( A \). An explanation involves identifying such statistically relevant factors and evaluating their impact within a reference class (a group of events or entities sharing common characteristics). For example, in explaining the likelihood of developing a particular disease, an SR explanation might highlight factors such as age, genetic predisposition, or lifestyle choices, showing how these variables alter the probability of the disease occurring. By uncovering these statistical relationships, the SR model provides a method for explaining probabilistic phenomena that cannot be addressed deterministically.

The \emph{Causal-Mechanical model}\index{Causal-Mechanical model}, or CM model, of scientific explanation emphasizes understanding phenomena by uncovering the underlying causal mechanisms that produce them (see causality at Section \ref{sec:scientific_justification}). This model asserts that explanations are not just about identifying laws or statistical relationships but about revealing the actual processes and interactions that link causes to effects. A causal-mechanical explanation requires tracing a continuous causal chain, often through detailed physical or biological processes, to show how an event is brought about. For example, explaining the boiling of water involves identifying the causal mechanism: heat energy transfers to the water molecules, increasing their kinetic energy until intermolecular bonds are overcome, leading to a phase change from liquid to gas. The CM model prioritizes clarity in how individual components interact and influence each other, providing a deeper understanding of the phenomenon by grounding it in observable and empirically testable mechanisms. This approach is particularly effective in fields like biology, physics, and engineering, where complex systems and their interactions play a central role in explanation.

The \emph{unificationist account}\index{Unificationist account} of scientific explanation, emphasizes the power of explanation through the unification of diverse phenomena under a single, coherent framework of principles and patterns. According to this model, the primary aim of scientific explanation is to reduce the number of independent assumptions and derive a wide range of phenomena from a minimal, consistent set of explanatory patterns. An explanation is considered successful if it contributes to this unifying framework by connecting seemingly disparate observations through common principles. For instance, Newtonian mechanics unifies the motions of celestial bodies and terrestrial objects under the same laws of motion and gravitation. The unificationist approach highlights the importance of simplicity, generality, and coherence in scientific theories, proposing that the value of an explanation lies in its ability to integrate knowledge into an organized, explanatory schema. By offering a comprehensive understanding of diverse phenomena, this account showcases the interconnectedness and systematic nature of scientific inquiry.

The \emph{pragmatic theories}\index{Pragmatic theories} of scientific explanation emphasize the context-dependent and audience-specific nature of explanations, focusing on their purpose and practical utility rather than strict formal structures. These theories argue that explanations are answers to "why" questions posed within a specific context, and their adequacy depends on how well they address the interests and background knowledge of the audience. A scientific explanation, therefore, is not inherently tied to a universal standard but varies depending on the explanatory goals, such as prediction, understanding, or control. For instance, explaining why a bridge collapsed might involve detailed structural analysis for engineers, whereas a simplified account focusing on the immediate cause, like high winds, might suffice for the general public. Pragmatic approaches recognize that explanatory demands can differ across disciplines, situations, and audiences, making the effectiveness of an explanation contingent on its relevance, clarity, and alignment with the inquirer's needs. This perspective underscores the interplay between scientific knowledge and its communication within varied practical contexts.

\section{Scientific Justification}
\label{sec:scientific_justification}

Scientific knowledge is often said to be justified by appeal to evidence. However, this justification is not as straightforward or conclusive as it might first appear. It has long been recognized that scientific knowledge can neither be conclusively proved nor conclusively disproved. The role of justification in science is therefore complex: it is always partial, provisional, and open to revision, rather than absolute or final.

Logicians distinguish between two fundamental kinds of reasoning: \emph{deduction and induction}. Deductive reasoning\index{Deduction} moves from general premises to conclusions that must be true if the premises are true. Inductive\index{Induction} reasoning moves from particular observations to general conclusions, and can lead from true premises to false conclusions. Scientists make use of induction whenever they generalize from a finite number of observations to broader laws, which they do constantly.

This reliance on induction gives rise to what is known as Hume's problem of induction. Any inductive inference assumes that the unexamined cases will resemble the examined ones, an assumption often called the "uniformity of nature." But this assumption cannot itself be proven, and so the rational justification of induction seems to rest on circular reasoning. Karl Popper responded to this difficulty by arguing that induction is not needed at all: science, he claimed, progresses by proposing bold conjectures and then trying to refute them through deductive tests. Although no amount of evidence can prove a scientific theory true, a single well-corroborated counterexample can, in principle, refute it. From this perspective, scientific theories are never justified as true, only as not-yet-falsified.

In practice, scientists also often justify theories by appealing to what is known as inference to the best explanation. When confronted with a body of evidence, they favor the theory that best explains it, typically one that is simpler, more coherent, and unifies disparate observations. This is an inherently comparative and evaluative notion of justification: a theory is considered justified not because it is proven true, but because it currently explains the data better than its rivals.

Much of modern science can be described as following the \emph{hypothetico-deductive method}\index{Hypothetico-deductive method}. A theory is proposed, from which testable predictions are deduced. These predictions are then confronted with observations or experimental results. If the results conflict with the predictions, the theory may need to be rejected or revised; if the results agree, the theory is supported, though never conclusively proven. This illustrates a fundamental feature of scientific justification: positive results support a theory only tentatively, while negative results can count against it. Yet even refutation is not straightforward, because failed predictions may stem from auxiliary assumptions, background theories, or experimental errors rather than from the core theory itself.

This underdetermination of theory by evidence means that evidence alone cannot logically force the acceptance or rejection of a theory. Instead, scientists must weigh multiple considerations when deciding which theory is best justified, including simplicity, explanatory power, and coherence with established knowledge.

Alongside these logical models, science often relies on probabilistic justification. Statistical inference allows scientists to estimate how likely their data would be if a given hypothesis were true. The Bayesian approach refines this by providing a formal framework for updating the degree of belief in a hypothesis when new evidence is obtained. Each new observation shifts the credibility of a hypothesis up or down, never proving it true but adjusting its level of justification relative to alternatives.

This view makes clear that justification in science is gradual and comparative: theories become more or less justified over time as evidence accumulates. However, it also shows the limits of justification. Bayesian methods assume that all relevant hypotheses are already under consideration, and cannot by themselves account for genuinely novel theories. They also depend on prior assumptions that may be subjective or biased. In large part, then, what counts as “justified” depends on what the scientific community currently considers possible or plausible.

Thomas Kuhn highlighted that justification is not theory-neutral. What counts as evidence, and how evidence is interpreted, depends on the conceptual framework or paradigm within which scientists are working. During periods of normal science, researchers largely take the paradigm for granted and evaluate theories in terms of how well they solve puzzles defined by it. When anomalies accumulate, a period of crisis can lead to a scientific revolution in which the old paradigm is replaced by a new one. Kuhn argued that competing paradigms are often incommensurable, lacking a common standard by which to compare them directly.

This means that the standards of justification themselves can shift when paradigms change. What once counted as strong evidence may later be dismissed as irrelevant, and what was once regarded as speculative may later be seen as well justified. This view challenges the traditional separation between the context of discovery and the context of justification: the criteria for what justifies a theory are historically and socially situated, not timeless or purely logical.

There is no universal algorithm that can mechanically determine which theory is best justified. Scientific virtues such as empirical fit, simplicity, explanatory power, and coherence often trade off against one another, and reasonable scientists may weigh them differently. As Paul Feyerabend argued, the history of science shows that methodological pluralism—even breaking the accepted rules—has sometimes been necessary for progress. Scientific justification is therefore not purely mechanical or formal, but involves the exercise of judgment, creativity, and even a degree of risk-taking.

Finally, justification in science often depends on establishing causal claims. This is usually done not through passive observation but through carefully designed experiments that isolate variables and eliminate confounding factors. Experimental results provide stronger justification because they actively create the conditions needed to test causal hypotheses. Yet they, too, are interpreted through theoretical assumptions, and their justificatory power depends on the soundness of those assumptions. Even causal claims are therefore not justified by observation alone, but by their integration into a broader theoretical framework.

\section{The Limits of Science}

Science has been one of the most successful human enterprises, providing powerful tools for understanding and transforming the world. Yet its scope is not unlimited. There are questions science is ill-suited to answer, boundaries it may never cross, and domains where its methods cease to apply. Recognizing these limits is not to diminish science, but to place it in the broader landscape of human inquiry.

Philosophy, for example, pursues questions beyond the reach of empirical investigation. It employs methods such as logical reasoning, thought experiments, and conceptual analysis, which seek clarity about the meaning and boundaries of our concepts rather than empirical predictions. These methods can reveal types of truths—about logic, meaning, or ethics—that lie outside science's domain. While science asks how the world works, philosophy can ask what existence itself means, or why there is something rather than nothing. Such metaphysical questions appear to fall beyond the scope of empirical methods.

Similarly, science can describe the consequences of actions, but it cannot tell us what we ought to value or how we ought to act. Moral and aesthetic judgments involve norms, not facts. Scientific results can inform ethical debates, but cannot settle them. This highlights a central boundary of science: it can describe what is, but not what ought to be.

Even within its own domain, science cannot explain everything. Any scientific explanation must rely on some fundamental laws or principles; yet those laws cannot themselves be explained by deeper laws without falling into infinite regress. There will therefore always be a point at which science must stop and accept certain principles as unexplained. This does not mean we can say in advance which questions are forever unanswerable, only that some will inevitably be so.

Moreover, science is constrained by what can be observed or indirectly detected. If an entity or phenomenon leaves no observable trace, then it is beyond the reach of empirical science. This raises subtle questions about the ontological status of unobservable entities: scientific theories may refer to them, but their existence can never be confirmed directly.

Another limit of science arises from its division into disciplines. Each scientific field is designed to explain a particular range of phenomena using its own methods. Physics, for example, studies the fundamental structure of matter, while sociology studies the structure of human societies. It is often assumed that the more fundamental sciences can, in principle, subsume the less fundamental ones—a view called reductionism. Yet many phenomena studied by the higher-level sciences are multiply realized at the physical level, and their behavior emerges from complex interactions not captured by lower-level laws alone. Holism emphasizes that some properties can only be understood at the level of the whole system. This suggests that even complete knowledge of physics would not automatically yield complete knowledge of biology, psychology, or culture.

A further limitation concerns the very nature of scientific knowledge. Scientific realists argue that science aims to describe the world as it truly is, including unobservable entities. Anti-realists reply that theories should be seen as instruments for predicting observable phenomena, not as literal descriptions of reality. One argument for anti-realism is the problem of underdetermination: the same body of empirical data can often be explained by many different, mutually incompatible theories. If evidence underdetermines theory, then perhaps we should suspend judgment about the reality of unobservable entities. Realists respond that not all explanations are equally good, and that virtues like simplicity, coherence, and explanatory power can guide rational choice. Yet the debate shows that even the status of scientific knowledge itself is contested.

Science is often described as objective, yet it is carried out by human beings embedded in cultural and social contexts. Research agendas, funding priorities, values, and personal biases all shape what questions are asked, how data are interpreted, and which results are accepted. This does not mean that science is purely subjective: its methods aim to correct for individual bias through replication, peer review, and open criticism. But recognizing these social influences reveals that scientific objectivity is an ideal rather than an automatic fact. The self-correcting nature of science works only because its claims remain open to challenge and revision.

Another important boundary is the demarcation between science and non-science. Popper famously proposed falsifiability as a criterion: a theory is scientific if it makes predictions that could in principle be shown false. This criterion has been influential, but not universally accepted, as some fields (such as string theory or evolutionary psychology) are difficult to test in practice yet still considered scientific by many. The demarcation problem shows that there is no single, universally agreed rule for what counts as science, and that the borders of science are themselves somewhat fluid and historically contingent.

Finally, some questions may remain permanently beyond science's reach. The ultimate origin of the universe, the nature of dark matter, or the final fate of reality may elude definitive answers. Science depends on its tools, and some phenomena might require conceptual frameworks or observational methods we cannot yet—and perhaps can never—develop. This does not make such questions meaningless, but it shows that science is only one strand in the broader human quest for knowledge.

Even where science can answer a question, it cannot tell us whether answering it is good or bad. The same knowledge that enables genetic engineering or artificial intelligence also raises profound ethical dilemmas about how such technologies should be used. Science can provide the means to achieve our ends, but it cannot choose the ends themselves. For this, we must appeal to ethical and political reasoning beyond the scope of empirical science.
