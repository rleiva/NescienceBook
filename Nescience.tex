After the preparatory chapters XX, XX, XX, in this chapter we are ready to introduce the concept of nescience, and to study its main properties.

Nescience, on the contrary of what happens with the entropy of Shannon or the complexity of Kolmogorov, is not a measure of the quantity of information; instead, what it measures is the lack of information, that is, the unknown. According to the theory of nescience, how much we do not know about a research entity is given by three elements: miscoding, inaccuracy and surfeit. Miscoding measures how good is the representation of the original entity as a string of symbols that we can use in our researh; inaccuracy measures how well our current best model escribe that string of symbols; and sufait measures how well we understand the description itself, based on the amount of non necessary elements it contains. The problem is that these quantities are incompatible, in the sense that decreasing one of the could increase the other two. And so, we have to find a way to minimize the three quantities at the same time, that is, Nescience is a multi-objective minimization problem.

One of the most important consequences of our definition of nescience, based on the two metrics of error and redundancy, is that it divides the space composed by the research topics into two different areas. The first area is what we call the known unknown, that is, the set of topics that we do not fully understand, but that we are aware that we do non fully understand them. The second area is the unknown unknown, composed by those topics that have not been discovered yet. An important application of the theory of nescience is as a methodology for the discovery of what hides in the unknown unknown.

A second important consequence of the concept of nescience is the highly counterintuitive property that sometimes, for a certain class of topics, further research could be a counterproductive activity. That is, that more research we do, the less we know, since for these topics it is not possible to increase our knowledge beyond a critical point, even if this point if far from being a perfect knowledge.

\section{Nescience}

Intuitively, how much we do not know about an entity should be based on the misscoding of the selected representation, and the surfeit and inaccuracy of the model used. Miscoding because ... Error because it says how close our description properly describes the topic, and redundancy because it tell us how unnecessarily effort are we spending with that particular description. Basically, what we are trying to achive is solve the following minimization problem:

... trade-off among three conflicting objectives ...

According to the theory of nescience, the scientific method is about solving the following multi-objective minimization problem:

\begin{tBox}
\textbf{The Science Problem}
\begin{align*}
 & \text{minimize} \quad \{ \mu(t), \iota(t, m), \sigma(m, t)\} \\
 & \text{subject to} \quad (t, m) \in \mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{M}
\end{align*}
\end{tBox}

... no single solution exists that simultaneously optimizes each objective? ... there exists a (possibly infinite) number of Pareto optimal solutions ...

Probably, the most surprising fact about our characterization of the scientific method is that it does not involve the set $\mathcal{E}$ of entities. Who could be that the scientific method does not require to know which are the entities under study? From a formal point of view we do not require to know the entity $e \in \mathcal{E}$ under study because that would make the scientific method an ill-defined problem. For a practical point of view, this will allow us to provide practical approximations to the problem, since we are only dealing with string manipulations. And form a philosophical point of view, we consider that science is about the discovery of the unknown.

In any case the problem is still very difficult to solve, since the functions i, um, m are non-linear, non-convex and incommensurable.

The above optimization problem defines the following pareto optimal surface.

\begin{definition}
An objective vector $n^\star \in \mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{M}$ is Pareto optimal if there does not exist another objective vector $n \in \mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{M}$ wuch that $\iota(t_2) \leq \iota(t_1)$, ...
\end{definition}

We could consider that descriptions lie in a two dimensional space where the axis are error and redundancy. The origin in this space would represent the perfect knowledge, that is, zero error and zero redundancy. Then, the nescience of a description would be the (Euclidean) distance between the point occupied by the description and the origin.

\begin{definition} [Nescience]
\label{def:nescience}
Let $t \in \mathcal{T}$ a topic and $m \in \mathcal{M}$ a model. We define the nescience of topic $t$ given the model $m$, denoted by $\nu\left(t, m \right)$, as:
\[
\nu\left(t, m \right) = \frac{3}{ \mu(t)^{-1} + \iota(t, m)^{-1} + \sigma(m, t)^{-1}} 
\]
\end{definition}

{\color{red} TODO: Explain the intuition behind this concept.}

\begin{example}
\label{ex:nescience}
Let $t \in \mathcal{T}$ a topic, and $d_1$ and $d_2$ two descriptions of $t$. Assume that the error of $d_1$ is $0.1$ and its redundancy $0.4$, and that $d_2$ has an error $0.2$ and a redundancy of $0.2$. According to Definition \ref{def:nescience}, the nescience of topic $t$ given the description $d_1$ would be $0.41$, and the nescience given the description $d_2$ would be $0.28$. Our unknown about topic $t$ would be smaller in case of description $d_2$ than with description $d_1$.
\end{example}

What Example \ref{ex:nescience} show us is that, given our definition of nescience, we should prefer a less redundant explanation that maybe does not describe perfectly a topic, to a highly redundant description that fits the topic much better. The Occam's razor principle states that between two indifferent alternatives we should select the simplest one. Our theory states that even in case they are not indifferent alternatives, it might be worth to select the the simplest one. The theory of nescience has not been designed to find the true about a topic, in its philosophical sense, but to find the best theory that can be used in practice. In this sense, we borrow concepts and ideas from the area of machine learning, and in particular, from the problem of \emph{model overfitting} when dealing with the results of an experiment (see Chapter \ref{chap:Model-Evaluation-Selection} for more information about this problem).

{\color{red} TODO: Explain why not other metrics of distance.}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:range_redundancy}
We have that $0 \leq \rho(d_t) \leq 1$ for all $t \in \mathcal{T}$ and $d_t \in \mathcal{D}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Given that $l\left(d_t\right)>0$ and that $K\left(t\right)>0$, since they are the lengths of non-empty strings, we only need to prove that $l\left(d_t\right) \geq K\left(t\right)$; however $l\left(d_t\right) < K\left(t\right)$ is a contradiction with the fact that $K\left(t\right)$ is the length of the shortest possible Turing machine that prints out $t$.
\end{proof}


{\color{red} TODO: Weak nescience}

% Approximation of nescience

{\color{red} Approximation of Nescience}

Nescience is a theoretical concept that presents multiple issues when we try to use it in practice. In this section we are going to review these limitations, and will see how we can circumvent them.

The second problem with the theory of nescience is that we need to know the length of the shortest possible description of a topic. This poses a kind of contradiction: if we were aware of the shorted possible description, this one would be our best description, and the nescience would be equal to zero. The fact that our knowledge is incomplete implies that we do not know the shortest possible description of a topic. In order to deal with this problem, we will introduce a weak version of the concept of nescience. The weak nescience is based on the current best description alone, and it does not involves the best possible description at all:

\[
\textit{Weak Redundancy} = \frac{\textit{length of best description} - \textit{Kolmogorov complexity of best description}}{\textit{Kolmogorov complexity of best description}}
\]

Our definition of weak nescience is based on the Kolmogorov complexity of our best description. Kolmogorov complexity is a concept that also presents serious limitations when it is applied in practice. The first one is that, although the complexity does not change when we change the universal reference machine, this is true up to a constant (that depends on the selected machines, but not on the topic itself). In practice, the size of this constant could be very large in comparison to the complexity of the descriptions we are studying. What we propose to do in case of the theory of nescience is to fix a universal reference machine. Since our definition of nescience is a relative measure of what we do not know, intended to compare the topics among themselves, and not an universal measure of unknown, we can fix the an universal Turing machine, and get rid of these constants. The second problem with the Kolmogorov complexity is that it is, in general, a non-computable quantity. As we have said, there are well-defined mathematical concepts that are beyond of the theoretical capabilities of computers. Kolmogorov complexity is one of such mathematical concepts: given a description, there is no algorithm capable of computing the shortest computer program that prints that description. In practice, what we have to do is to approximate the Kolmogorov complexity by the length of the compressed text of the best known description.

% Joint Nescience
%

\section{Joint Nescience}

We are also interested in our current understanding of the concatenation of two topics.

\begin{definition}
Given $t,s \in \mathcal{T}$ two different topics, and the set $\mathcal{D}_{t,s} = \{ d \in \mathcal{B}^\ast, d = \langle TM,a \rangle : TM(a) = \langle t,s \rangle \}$, let $\hat{d}_{t,s}$ be a distinguished element of $\mathcal{D}_{t,s}$. We call $\hat{d}_{t,s}$ our \emph{current best joint description} of $t$ and $s$.
\end{definition}

The concept of best joint description could be a little bit misleading, since given that the concatenation of any two topics is another topic, we could ask ourselves why do not simply use our current best description of the topic represented by that concatenation. That would make sense only in case that somebody has already studied both topics together. However, for the overwhelming majority of the possible combinations of topics, nobody has studied them yet.

\begin{example}
\label{ex:unknown_join}
Let $t$ and $s$ two different topics, and assume that nobody has studied them together before. In this case, our current best description $\hat{d}_{t, s}$ would be $\langle TM, \langle \hat{d}_t, \hat{d}_s \rangle \rangle$, where $TM$ is a Turing machine that given the input $\langle \hat{d}_t, \hat{d}_s \rangle$ prints out the string $ts$. If $\hat{d}_t = \langle TM_t, a_t \rangle$ and $\hat{d}_s = \langle TM_s, a_s \rangle$, the machine $TM$ will decode $\hat{d}_t$, run $TM_t(a_t)$ to print out $t$; then it would do the same for $\hat{d}_s$ to print $s$.
\end{example}

In the theory of nescience it is also needed to know the joint nescience of two topics. Intuitively, the joint nescience of two topics given by our current understanding of both topics, and the shortest string that allows us to effectively reconstruct them.

\begin{definition}[Joint Nescience]
Let $t,s \in T$ be two different topics. We define the \emph{joint nescience} of topic $t$ and $s$, denoted by $\nu(t,s)$, as: 
\[
\nu(t, s) = \left( \epsilon\left( t, s \right)^2 + \rho\left( t,s \right)^2 \right) ^ \frac{1}{2}
\]
\end{definition}

Next proposition shows that the combined nescience of two topics is greater or equal than the nescience of any of them isolated.

\begin{proposition}
Given any two topics $t,s \in T$, we have that $\nu(t,s) \geq \nu(t)$ and $\nu(t,s) \geq \nu(s)$.

\[
\nu(t \mid s) = \left( \epsilon\left( t \mid s \right)^2 + \rho\left( t \mid s \right)^2 \right) ^ \frac{1}{2}

We have that $\nu(t) > \nu(t \mid s)$ for all topics $t, s \in T$.

{\color{red} Review:}
\[
N_t = \frac{l\left(\hat{d_t}\right) - K(t)}{K(t)} > \frac{l\left(\hat{d_t}\right) - K(t)}{K(t) + l\left(d_s^\star \right)} = \frac{l\left(\hat{d_t}\right) + l\left(d_s^\star \right) - K(t) - l\left(d_s^\star \right)}{K(t) + l\left(d_s^\star \right)} = \frac{l\left(\langle d_s^\star, \hat{d_t} \rangle \right)-K(t \mid s)}{K(t \mid s)} = N_{t \mid s}
\]

Finally, next proposition states the relation between nescience, conditional nescience and joint nescience.

The concept of conditional nescience can be extended to multiple topics $s_1, \ldots, s_n$, using the standard encoded string $\langle s_1^\star, \ldots, s_n^\star, a \rangle$ and the multiple conditional complexity $K (t \mid s_1, \ldots, s_n)$.

\begin{definition}
Let $t, s_1, \ldots, s_n \in T$ a collection of topics. The \emph{conditional nescience} of topic $t$ given the topics $s_1, \ldots, s_n$ and current best description $\hat{d_t}$ is defined as: 
\[

\end{definition}

% Section: Nescience of Areas
%

\section{Nescience of Areas}
\label{sec:nescience_areas}

Topics can be grouped into research areas. The concept of area is useful as long as all the topics included in the area share a common property. The particular details of the grouping properties depend on the practical applications of the theory.

\begin{definition}
An area $A$ is a subset of topics, that is $A \subset \mathcal{T}$.
\end{definition}

Areas can overlap, that is, given two areas $A$ and $B$ it might happen that $A \cap B \neq \varnothing$. Areas can be subsets of other areas, creating an hierarchy of areas.

\begin{example}
If the set of topics is "mathematics", examples of areas could be "calculus", "geometry" or "algebra". The areas "probability" and "statistics" largely overlap. The area "Bayesian inference" is a subarea of the area "probability".
\end{example}

{\color{red} TODO: study the properties of the research areas.}

In the same way we studied the properties of individual topics, we could study the properties of areas. An \emph{area} is a subset of topics $A\subset T$. The concept of area is useful as long as all the topics included in the area share a common property. What is exactly that property tehy share depends on the particular set $T$.

\begin{definition}
Given an area $A\subset T$, we define the \emph{average complexity of the area} $C_{A}$ as $C_{A}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t\in A}C_{t}$, and the \emph{average nescience of the area} $N_{A}$ as $N_{A}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t\in A}N_{t}$, where $n$ is the cardinality of $A$.
\end{definition}

For example, in case of research topics, an area could be a knowledge area, like biology, that will contain all the topics classified under that area. In this way we could compute and compare the complexity (how difficult is to understand) and the nescience (how ignorant we are) of mathematics, physics, biology, social sciences, and other disciplines.

{\color{red} TODO: This definition can only be introduced once we have the concept of best current description.}

An even easier approximation of the concept of redundancy of an area, is based on the average redundancy of the topics that compose that area.

\begin{definition}
Let $A \in \mathcal{T}$ an area, and $d_A$ a description. We define the \emph{average redundancy of the description} $d_A$ as:
\[
\bar{\rho}(d_{\hat{A}}) = \sum
\]
\end{definition}

% Section: Perfect Knowledge
%

\section{Perfect Knowledge}

As we have said, in our opinion, the objective of scientific research should be to reduce the nescience of topics as much as possible. When it is not possible to reduce more the nescience of a topic, we propose to say we have reached a perfect knowledge. A consequence of 

\begin{definition}[Perfect Knowledge]
If the nescience of a topic $t$ is equal to cero ($\nu(t)=0$), we say that we have reached a \emph{perfect knowledge} about topic $t$.
\end{definition}

If $\nu(t)=0$ we have that $\epsilon(t) = \rho(t) = 0$, that is, perfect knowledge is achieved when we can fully reconstruct the original topic given its description, and the description does not contains any redundant elements. A consequence of our definition is that perfect knowledge implies randomness, that is, incompressible descriptions. The converse, in general, does not hold. The common point of view is that a random string should make nonsense, since this is what randomness is all about. However, in the theory of nescience, by random description we means a description that contains the maximum amount of information in the less space as possible (it contains no redundant elements).

\begin{example}
Aristotelian physics is an inaccurate description of our world, since it makes some predictions that does not hold in reality (for example, planets do not orbit around the earth). We could use a description of the Aristotelian physics and compress it using a standard compression program. The compressed file would be a random description (zero redundancy). However, given that description, our nescience would not be zero, that is, our knowledge would not be perfect, since the error of the description is not zero.
\end{example}

In order to clarify how the above theorem can be applied in practice, in Figure \ref{fig:Perfect_Knowledge} it is shown an hypothetical example of the typical research process required to understand a scientific topic $t\in T$. In time $t_{1}$ we have a description with length $12$, whose compressed version has a length of $5$, and so, its nescience is $1.4$. In time $t_{2}$, supposedly after some intense research effort, our current description length has been reduced to $8$ with a complexity of $4$, and our nescience has decreased to $1$. In the limit, the description length will be equal to its complexity (incompressible description), and the nescience will be 0. In this moment we could say that we have a \emph{perfect knowledge} about that particular research topic.

% Current Best Description
%

\section{Current Best Description}

As we said in the preface of this chapter, in order to compute how much we do not know about a topic, first we need a way to quantify what we already know about that topic. How much we know about a topic will be given by our current best known description of that topic.

\begin{definition}
Given the set of descriptions $\mathcal{D}_t$ of a topic $t \in \mathcal{T}$, let $\hat{d_{t}}$ be a distinguished element of $\mathcal{D}_t$. We call $\hat{d_{t}}$ our \emph{current best description} of $t$.
\end{definition}

Which description is the current best description is something that depends on our current knowledge about the particular area in which the theory of nescience is being applied.

% Section: Nescience based on Datasets
%

\section{Nescience based on Datasets}
\label{sec:nescience_datasets}

Some topics can be described unsing a mathematical model that can
be evaluated by a computer. For those topics we could estimate their
complexity using a sample dataset, for example the result of an experiment.
This property allow us, among other things, to compare how well topics
are described by different models (see Chapter \ref{chap:Structured-Datasets}).

\begin{definition}
Let $t\in T$ be a topic, $D=\left\{ x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}\right\} $
the result of running an experiment that describes $t$, and $H$
a mathematical hipothesis for $t$. The complexity of the topic $t$
given the current description $H$ and the dataset $D$ is given by

\[
\hat{C}_{t}=L(H)+L(D\mid H)
\]
as it is described by the minimum description length principle.
\end{definition}

Given the dataset $D$ and the model $H$ we can compute our current
nescience of a topic as it is described by the next definition.

\begin{definition}
Let $t\in T$ a topic, $D=\left\{ x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}\right\} $
the result of running an experiment that describes $t$, $C$ a code
that minimizes the length of $D$, and $H$ a mathematical hipothesis
for $t$. The current complexity of the topic $t$ given the dataset
$D$ and the hyphotesis $H$ is given by

\[
N_{t}=\frac{\hat{C_{t}}-l_{C}(D)}{l_{C}(D)}
\]

\end{definition}

In practice, the dataset $D$ also allows us to approximate our current
nescience of a topic $t$, given the model $H$. What we have to do
is to use a near minimal encoding for $D$, for example, by using
a Huffam encoding.
