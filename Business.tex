\chapter{New Business Opportunities}
\label{chap:business-opportunities}

All entrepreneurs (should) know that in order to start a successful business one has to satisfy at least four requirements:

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find a product that people need, want and is willing to pay for it.
\item Select a growing market, where there is almost no competition, and there are no major barriers (legal, technological, ...) that prevent you to enter.
\item Gather the money, tools and knowledge necessary to produce this product at a cost lower than what people is willing to pay.
\item Hire a team of highly motivated, skilled and healthy employees.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

Point 2 is covered by the area of Market Analysis, point 3 by Project Management, and point 4 by Team Management. Unfortunately, there is no discipline that explicitly address point 1. Here it is where our theory of nescience can help. In this chapter we will propose a methodology for the identification of new \emph{interesting business opportunities} based on the analysis of those people's needs that are not covered, or they are badly covered, by current existing products. 

How well are people's needs satisfied by current products is estimated using our theory of nescience; the higher the nescience associated to a product, the worse the product covers a need. What people want will be estimated using a relevance graph, based on people's purchases of products; moreover, in this particular case the graph will be a labeled one in order to estimate how much people is willing to pay. The combination of highly mature products with unsolved needs could help us to identify interesting ideas for the development of new products. Finally, we will show how we can identify new needs that people was not aware they had, reaching the area of the unknown people's needs.

The proposed methodology will be evaluated using data from real products, purchases and prices.
